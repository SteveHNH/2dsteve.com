<span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><p>I really need to get better at this whole blogging thing. I keep telling myself to write and then I just don&rsquo;t do it, and it saddens me. I have a lot to catch you guys up on. The awesome thing about it is that it&rsquo;s all good news! I love good news.</p><p>Last weekend, I took a trip up to West Virginia to see my beautiful, amazing, wonderful fiance and celebrate our engagement with our friends and her familiy. It was the coolest party ever. I can&rsquo;t believe how much trouble her family went through to make it so memorable for us both. They got mint tins and napkins with our names on them, they had TONS of food, and really nice decorations. Her dad toasted us with a very heartfelt speech.Â  The whole thing was great. I also got to see tons of my friends and a lot of Stephanie&rsquo;s family that I had seen before and some that I haven&rsquo;t. All in all, we had a blast.</p><p>Ashley decided to come back down to Florida with me to see Chris, and we had a very interesting drive down that 11 hour road. It ended up being a 14 hour drive due to my inability to differentiate between East and West. I took I-26 West instead of I-26 East. This wrong turn took us 93 miles in the wrong direction to Spartanburg, SC. If you don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;m talking about, check out a map. We ended up having to go down I-85 and through Atlanta, GA. It wasn&rsquo;t a bad drive, because Ashley was really understanding and decided not to beat the crap out of me and leave me for dead. Although I wouldn&rsquo;t have blamed her if she did. I easily added 3 hours to our already too long trip. It sucked. But, we did arrive safely here in Florida, albeit extra tired and completely annoyed with driving.</p><p>This week, Ashley and I also got the chance to go on an online radio show called Horseshoes and Hand Grenades. I know, you must be asking yourself, &ldquo;But, Stephen, aren&rsquo;t you on a show every week called that?&rdquo; Why yes! Ashley and I pretty much jacked their name on accident and they had us on the show to interview us about it. We got to explain how it all happened, and we had a few laughs in the process. They are some all around good people and we had a blast on the show. So go check it out at <a href=http://www.hhradio.net>http://www.hhradio.net</a>.</p><p>I also got to celebrate my birthday with all my buddies on Saturday, and it was freakin&rsquo; awesome. We played the wii, pirate dice, and ate some awesome food. I&rsquo;m 22, but I don&rsquo;t feel any different. I never feel any different on birthdays. I&rsquo;ll just be glad when my insurance goes down :) .</p><p>Anyway, I can&rsquo;t half concentrate because Heroes is on and it&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; awesome. You guys stay cool&mldr;I&rsquo;m gonna finish watching this show :).</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.2dsteve.com/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
