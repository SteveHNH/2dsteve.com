<span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><p>Man, I need to do a much better job of keeping this blog up-to-date with the goings on in my life. Not too much has actually happened. I guess the first thing I should do is update you on the ongoing saga of me trying to get a job in WV.</p><p>The job that I thought I had a good shot at didn&rsquo;t quite work out. I got a letter in the mail telling me that I wasn&rsquo;t what they were looking for. I don&rsquo;t get it. Even the guy who interviewed me said that I EXACTLY what they were looking for. I&rsquo;m thinking that they just didn&rsquo;t want to hire me since I live in Tallahassee. I emphasized that I would be relocating, but I guess it just didn&rsquo;t get through to him. Either way, I&rsquo;ve still got a few more chances at getting a job somewhere up there. Me and Steph just can&rsquo;t keep doing this forever and I hope somebody up there will have some compassion and help me out. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m just a bum trying to get a hand out. I&rsquo;ll work hard for them and do everything I can to make it worth their while.</p><p>Anyway, I&rsquo;ve run that whole topic into the ground over the last few posts. I&rsquo;ve also been working hard on Pi and CHiPS stuff, and trying to get it off the ground. I&rsquo;ve kind of worn myself out in a lot of ways though, as I am doing a ton of work on it and I could probably delegate a lot of the tasks. The Adventures of Jim Doogan is a podcast that I didn&rsquo;t anticipate being as challenging as it is. Coming up with a story has been the hardest part for all of us and I think we may have jumped the gun in releasing a couple episodes. I think that if I didn&rsquo;t have an 8 to 5 job and 2 other podcasts to think about, I may have more of an opportunity to work on that show. I can now say that I respect people who write TV shows a whole lot more. Not only do you have to think about the current episode you are writing, but also the complete story arc of the season. It&rsquo;s a whole lot to think about and make sure you don&rsquo;t contradict yourself at any point. I&rsquo;m kind of bad at that.</p><p>Another problem I&rsquo;ve found is that the pirate adventure genre has pretty much been tapped of all material. Pirates of the Caribbean evidently made sure to soak up every bit of pirate lore that they could. All the superstitions and tales were used in those movies. Treasure, curses, voodoo ladies, Davy Jones, Flying Dutchman, and governer&rsquo;s daughters have all been covered already. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll be able to nail down something, but it doesn&rsquo;t look like we&rsquo;ll be keeping our &ldquo;every other tuesday&rdquo; schedule. I just don&rsquo;t have the time necessary to work on a show like this right now, and I don&rsquo;t want to produce crap. That&rsquo;s pretty much my main concern.</p><p>All the other shows are going well though, and I can only hope that people will start listening and enjoying all the shows we produce. They are pretty high quality and the information we provide is good. We&rsquo;re no <a href=http://www.revision3.com>Revision 3</a>, but we&rsquo;re working on it!</p><p>You guys take it easy! I&rsquo;ll update this again soon :)</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a><a class=category href=/categories/podcasting/>podcasting</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.2dsteve.com/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
