<span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><p>I was sitting around editing together another little masterpiece to herald H&H&rsquo;s triumphant return, then I remembered, it&rsquo;s blog time! I also felt my stomach rolling over and over thanks to the fiber bar, fiber brownie, high fiber taco shells, and refried beans I had today. Why would someone eat that?! I think I was replacing other foods I typically ate with a similar equivalent, but for some reason everything had &ldquo;high fiber&rdquo; written on it. This is very unfortunate for me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve also been thinking of ways to help promote our upcoming return to interwebs. I was going through a lot of the old episodes today, just listening to the old stuff to see why we had so much fun to start with. I&rsquo;ve never laughed so hard. We had so much fun doing that show, and I can&rsquo;t wait to come back and keep doing it. I think it will be one of those times where you realize that you never should have quit and it picks up right where it left off. At least I hope that&rsquo;s how it feels. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve lost a step when it comes to talking on the internet. I was really reminded of how good our show really was when I was listening to those episodes. I&rsquo;ve heard a lot of podcasts, and ours really kills it as far as quality goes. We may go off the rails a bit, but at least we sound awesome doing it!</p><p>I have got to get back on the bus when it comes to this whole exercise thing. I was doing really well there a while back, and I was so proud of myself. I need to find a way to capture that again, because I just haven&rsquo;t been able to pull myself out of this rutt I&rsquo;ve found myself in. I tried to do P90X shoulders & arms the other day, and I nearly died. I thought I was going to vomit it hurt so bad. But that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s supposed to feel the first day back. I need to just make myself do it everyday. I&rsquo;m not going to get any healthier by sitting around and watching TV. I&rsquo;m at least eating better, but that&rsquo;s not everything. Steph and I want to climb one of the more challenging trails in the Smoky Mountains this year, so we have to get on the ball!</p><p>In coding news, I finished my web app today. I got a bunch of feature requests to chug through now though. I was so proud of it until I saw that it really didn&rsquo;t meet many of the expectations that were had :(. Eh, I guess I&rsquo;ll just keep chugging away until it works. It&rsquo;s just frustrating to work that long on something and have it not get that great of a reception. I want it to change the world, and it just didn&rsquo;t. Maybe my expectations were too high. I&rsquo;ll get back on the ball tomorrow and make something happen. I need to seriously make some progress or doing something significant. I feel like I&rsquo;m in over my head sometimes. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s just me though. I&rsquo;m tough on myself&mldr;and I should quit. It&rsquo;s really annoying >_&lt;</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/internet/>Internet</a><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a><a class=category href=/categories/podcasting/>podcasting</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://stevehnh.github.io/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
