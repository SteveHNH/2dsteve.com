<span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><p>Well, it looks like if I can survive the weekend I have made it through the first ninety days of my new job! That means that I&rsquo;m over my probationary period and can start slacking off&mldr;which is not what I do at all :P. I&rsquo;m just glad to know that the blue devils have decided to keep me around and have me continue hacking away at their machines as if they are my personal play toys. Yeah, I don&rsquo;t do that either. I&rsquo;ve always been very careful with big ol&rsquo; servers and measure twice, cut once. Or I measure 60+ times because I always worry that I&rsquo;ll miss a decimal point somewhere.</p><p>I&rsquo;m really happy with how my new job has turned out though. I have had a couple moments of &ldquo;oh crap, I hope I did that right,&rdquo; but all in all it&rsquo;s been fantastic. I work with a bunch of really encouraging and helpful guys that have made me feel right at home. I think that the personalities of the people you work with are definitely just as important as their knowledge and experience. Because if  you can&rsquo;t get along with people, you definitely can&rsquo;t work well with them. I think we&rsquo;re doing pretty good so far. A lot of things are on the plate that need to get done and I&rsquo;m happy to be able to contribute to it all.</p><p>I also found out, only yesterday, that I do NOT have to badge in at the badge reader when I get to work. I&rsquo;ve been doing that every day since I started! I had no idea. I&rsquo;m actually an employee of a different department in the Duke Health System, but it&rsquo;s really just separated by the paperwork. I was just doing the same thing that everyone else on my team was doing, but I was finally told yesterday that it was completely unnecessary. There are apparently a handful of differences from me and the other guys that make my position a little better and a little worse depending on the situation. I automatically get a few holidays that the other guys take PTO for, but it really doesn&rsquo;t matter in the end because it all comes out the same. I just HAVE to take those holidays or I&rsquo;ll lose them. It kind of sucks I can&rsquo;t bank them, but it doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much. I usually want a day off by the time those days roll around anyway :)</p><p>Oh, man! I hit a milestone today in more than one way. Today is the first day of February! I managed to blog every day for the month of January except for that one stupid Saturday  that I played Assassin&rsquo;s Creed all night. That was really unfortunate :(. I need to print a new Seinfeldian Chain now! Here we go!</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a><a class=category href=/categories/work/>Work</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://stevehnh.github.io/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
