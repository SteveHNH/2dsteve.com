Man oh man oh man oh man! I just watched the Star Wars Teaser Trailer for the 2nd time today! I would've watched it more but I'm in class and I don't want to bother everybody else! Yeah man though, this thing is gonna be awesome.  I'm going to see it right when it comes out I know. It's gonna be all dark and cool and....stuff.
Well anyway! I think I'm gonna go see The Incredibles tonight becuase I love those Pixar movies man. They're awesome. I've heard reviews said that it was a really really good movie. So I'm might go see it tonight. Well I don't have anything else to say now. WOO STAR WARS!!
