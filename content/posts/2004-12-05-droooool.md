I found these pictures of what EA says will be the next generation of thier games. They look SO awesome! Its crazy! I was impressed by the new football games because of the incredible realism, but this totally blows them out of the water! Its ridiculous! I never thought games could look so real.  I would have posted the pictures but it wasn't working, so click the link below.

In other news! [Dan Huard](http://danhuard.typepad.com) now has a blog! This is awesome because I always liked Dan and it was sad to see him leave my TV screen, but now we can all still keep up with what he's doing. Awesome! Now if only Yoshi would get a blog. Maybe someday.
