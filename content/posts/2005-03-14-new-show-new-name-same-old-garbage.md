I've come across some good news and some bad news involving The Screen Savers. I don't know why I continue to talk about this show, considering I don't even watch it anymore, but I guess since I'm such a fan of [Kevin Rose](http://www.kevinrose.com/) and [other](http://www.scopetech.net/) [Screen Savers](http://www.leoville.com/) [personalities](http://www.sarahlane.com/), I feel a little bit attached.

Anyway, [Chi-Lan](http://chubbybrain.blogspot.com/) is leaving G4 in favor of a job at STUFF magazine as a tech gadget girl or something or other. I'm not really sad about her leaving because she was probably the worst co-host EVER in the history of the show. That's not the bad news. The bad news is that the show is officially changing it's name sometime soon and heading in a completely different direction. So for those of you who do care about it, the show we all once loved is officially dead. Apparently Chi-Lan was excited about leaving because as most ex-G4 employees will tell you, the company sucks.

Rumor has it that the show will be renamed to "Attack of the show"....which I highly doubt is true because that name seriously sucks.

I am however still looking forward to more episodes of [Kevin Rose's](http://www.kevinrose.com/) show "[thebroken](http://www.thebroken.org/)", plus the new show that they are putting together that will be more like the old TSS. Those will be downloadable from the internet and are hopefully going ot be full of the tech content that I know we all miss from our once favorite show.
