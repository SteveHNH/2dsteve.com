It's adventure game night! I'm playing **The Cave** for the next couple of weeks. I started the stream last week and had a blast. It's a fairly old game at this point, but it still feels fresh and new to me. I only ever played it one time and I never finished it. I'm not sure WHY I didn't finish it. Maybe it had something to do with where my life was at the time. I don't know.

I really dig doing this adventure game stream because it forces me to revisit old games that I loved, and also try out new stuff that wasn't even on my radar before. I have a pretty decent list of games I want to play on the stream. I'm sure some are going to be misses, like **The Witness**, but most of them are bound to provide some level of fun for me. I've already made quite a dent in that list, but I have plenty of time to keep adding stuff and chugging through it.

I'll be streaming live at 8:30pm EST on [2DorksTV](http://www.twitch.tv/2dorks). Swing by and say hello! You can find last weeks episode below to see how much fun and clever this game is.
