I'm a big fan of dialects. I love the way people sound and how they sound different. I love them so much that when spending time with someone who has a different accent, I might accidentally start mimicking them. I don't mean to, it just happens. I'm a bit of a parrot and always have been. Doing voices and accents is just one of the things wrapped up in how I'm made.

I found this super cool video today on North American dialects and where they come from. It's FASCINATING. Not only do they mimick the accents really well, but they take time to explain the little nuances that you hear but don't necessarily understand. It's a fun watch.
