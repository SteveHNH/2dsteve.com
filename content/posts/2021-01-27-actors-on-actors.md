Variety's Actors on Actors series is pretty great. I listen to them while I'm doing work and it's a lot like a podcast. Just two actors chatting about their craft. There are definitely those moments of marketing for whatever movie they were in at the time of filming, but altogether you learn a little bit about how they operate.

Here's a fun one I watched that featured Jeff Bridges and Matthew McConaughey. It's like hanging out with two chill dudes just letting them tell stories
