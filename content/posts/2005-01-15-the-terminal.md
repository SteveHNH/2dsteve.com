I just watched The Terminal last night and I have to say that it was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It was just so .....good! I really don't know what else to say about it. It was so funny and just downright enjoyable. I'm a huge Tom Hanks AND Steven Spielberg fan and any time those two get together you can just expect an awesome movie. The Terminal was no exception.

It's about this foriegn guy who gets to an airport only to discover that his country was overthrown by rebels while he was in the air. This means that he no longer has a country and his passes are no longer valid to pass into the United States. But he can also not go home! So the guy is stuck in the airport until his country is put back together. From there it just gets awesome. Tom Hanks was such a convincing russian-type guy that you hardly even remember that he is actually American in real life. Its crazy! He did an awesome job. So anyway, you guys should go check out The Terminal because it is really an awesome movie.
