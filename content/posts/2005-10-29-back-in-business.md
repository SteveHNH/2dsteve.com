I fixed my computer!


Yeah man! I'm so excited about it too because this mobo I bought turned out to be way better than I expected it to be. It's got overclocking utilities and a really simple driver installation. It's also got USB 2.0 and...well maybe that's it but it's still awesome! It also has hyper-threading support...although my processor doesn't do hyper-threading. I'm just glad my computer works again and I've got it all set up mostly like it was before it broke. I chose not to install a few programs that I rarely used just to save space and not clutter up anything.


I haven't messed with the overclocking program yet because I've learned a hard lesson from all of this: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. So I am going to leave that alone, but at least you now know that Gigabyte mobos come with a nifty Windows over clocking utility. I have a standard fan on my processor so I don't want to touch it. Maybe if I had a bigger fan or...water cooling..yeah that's it! Wait, I'm not giong to think about it because I don't want to mess anything up....again.


I'm back to playing WoW now and all is well. I actually played Battlegrounds today and my internet connection doesn't do too bad. Of course I was getting some really good ping time today for some reason. I got about 68 kills out of 2 games. That's pretty good for me considering I've never really played BG. I'm a Private now..oh yeah!


Well that's it for now. Take it easy!
