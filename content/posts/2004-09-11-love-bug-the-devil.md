Man I had an adventure today! I went to the citgo station and just got back. I went through at least 3 million STUPID love bugs on the way back. There were so many that I thought it had started raining. Its ridiculous. They're crazy down here in Florida right now. They're these really little bugs that serve no purpose but to smear up people's windsheilds and cause visibility problems. I couldn't see at all! I didn't know if I was gonna make it to the citgo or not. Luckily, they had a windshield cleaner squeegy thing that I could use. Man its crazy.
I'm done ranting about that now. I thought I'd start this cool thing today! I decided that every Friday I'm gonna post 5 random songs that are on my iPod right now and another song that I've been rockin' to on my pc. So here is my list for this week:

Randomly Generated iPod Songs
1.  My name is Jonas - Weezer
2. Suburban Myth - Less Than Jake
3. The Brilliant Dance - Dashboard Confessional
4. The Spoils of the Spoiled - The New Amsterdams
5. Breathing - Yellowcard
And the song thats been rockin my speakers!
CAPITAL H - MOTION CITY SOUNDTRACK

So yeah, I just thought that would be pretty fun, and I hope you enjoyed it. You should listen to those bands because they are all super awesome. Take it easy you guys! Be cool! Later!
