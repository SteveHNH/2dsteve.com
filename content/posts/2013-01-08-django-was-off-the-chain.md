So I just went to see Quentin Tarantino's latest film and I have to say this BLEW MY MIND. I had no idea what to expect to be honest, and a lot of the time I walk out of Tarantino flicks having to think about what I just saw. I don't have to think at all to see the awesomeness of Django. This movie had everything you could want: evil villains, great heroes, epic story, love, incredible characters, the works! I think that Christoph Waltz and Tarantino were born to make movies together. Waltz helps breathe so much life into the words on the page that it appears effortless. He did a remarkable job as Dr. King Schultz, bounty hunter. I could watch him read the phone book.<!-- more -->

This movie definitely had its share of gut punches throughout. Seeing the raw presentation of the most evil of slaveowners was pretty tough to see at times. At a point in history, these kinds of situations were real and Django Unchained doesn't forgive the acts of the past by watering them down. Quentin shows you each and every nasty part of the whole business, and it's really heartbreaking when you get right down to it. But, he doesn't let you stay heartbroken for long. This movie packs plenty of long belly laughs and, along with it, tons of blood. I have to say that I'm incredibly glad I've never seen a bullet hit someone, but I think it would probably be a lot less flashy than what Tarantino wanted to show. Blood goes EVERYWHERE! It's like people have little pocket grenades that go off whenever they get hit with a bullet. In all honesty, if it wasn't for it just being Tarantino's style, I would have called it distracting. There's a lot of blood, and it really doesn't add much.

There are tons of scenes that had me busting a gut though. Anytime Dr. Schultz is trying to explain his occupation after offing someone, you have to laugh or you aren't human. It's a ridiculous situation and this man weaves a tapestry of words that gets him right where he needs to be to safely walk away. I loved it! It was so incredibly enjoyable to watch. Jamie Foxx definitely holds his own as Django as well. He's a powerful presence and played such an amazing part. I know that Quentin had written the role for Will Smith, but I'm so glad that he had to back out and let us have Jamie Foxx. He did an amazing job. Someone deserves an Oscar for this movie.

Well done, Mr. Tarantino! Now where's our 1930's gangster flick!?
