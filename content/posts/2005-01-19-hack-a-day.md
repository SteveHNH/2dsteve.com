I've been checking out this site called [hackaday.com](http://www.hackaday.com) and I now want to hack everything in my house! It's so awesome what people do with their spare time. I wish I was creative enough to come up with even one of these awesome hacks. You guys should all check it out! They have hacks for everything from cellphones to digital cameras to ipods. It's good stuff to look at if you just need a project to do. If I get around to doing one of these things I'll post it on here. Later!
