As I sit and write this blog post almost every part of my body is in pain. I rolled down a mountain today, voluntarily mind you, and I hit just about ever part of my body on the way down. This weekend was the weekend of the famous snowboard trip where some friends from Florida venture up to West Virginia and we fly down a mountain strapped to the equivalent of a two-by-four. This was my first time snowboarding and as exciting as it was, I think I'm ready to call it quits on my snowboarding career. I'm more of a sunshine and warm weather sports person. The winter X-Games will never be a place you'll see me.

We did have an awesome time though! I've got to hang out with my friends Matt, Micah, Lance, and Phillip in a condo up in Snowshoe and we've had a blast. I can't say I didn't have a good time snowboarding either because I really did enjoy myself. I just freaked out every time I got a little bit of speed and just fell down the mountain. I didn't take nearly as many bad spills as Steph and Ash did though. They got completely beat to death by a few these trails. I knocked my head on the ground pretty good a couple times and wasn't wearing a helmet because I'm an idiot. Snow is supposed to be soft, right?

Needless to say, 2 and a half days of this crap was enough. I don't think I'm going to be doing it anymore for this trip. I've had enough of hurling myself down the mountain. I think we're going to eat at one of the many restaurants up here for lunch. I had an amazing basket of cheese fries last night. Needless to say, you don't want to come up here without food if you are trying to watch what you it. This stuff is chock full of calories!

I wish I got some more video of our actual snowboarding, but it's kind of hard to do with the gloves on. Maybe I'll splice together some video of us just hanging out becuase we have had a good time doing that. Woo woo!
