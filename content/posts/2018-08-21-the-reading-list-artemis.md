_The Reading List is a segment of the blog where I let you know the thing I just read and some thoughts about it along with the next book in my list. Should you want to read along with me, let me know in the comments! _







I was a huge fan of _The Martian_ by Andy Weir. I listened to the audiobook twice. There was something about it that spoke to me. Mainly the engineering aspect of it. It used science to fight back against a planet that was trying to kill the protagonist, Mark Wattney. With every step forward, something would put him two steps back because he had some other thing to figure out. It also followed the skill and expertise of a team on earth that helped get him home. There was a lot of hope involved in that book. Good people trying to save a man stranded on a planet thousands of miles from home.







Artemis is not that story. Artemis is about a smuggler named Jasmine Bashara, Jazz for short. She's not a good person. You might even consider her a bad person. At the very least, she is a morally ambiguous person who has certain people she cares about but everyone else can die in a fire. 







I love Jazz.







It's not that she's horrible, but rather that she's so fun to read. This whole book is written in the first person, and I'm so glad it is. With that perspective you get every bit of what Jazz is thinking and I love the way her mind works. It's messed up, but always in a humorous and witty way. Andy Weir is a sarcastic son of a gun, and it shines through so well in this story.







The science is on full display here as it always is with his work. There's not nearly as much problem solving here, but it's not that kind of story. Instead you get little tidbits of info about what life is like on a lunar colony. He does a great job of reminding you that this is some kind of outpost in a desolate landscape every so often. The rules for living on a lunar colony are on full display and it's all about keeping people alive. 







Jazz gets wrapped up in an incredibly believable mob conspiracy, and I have no doubt that something like this might occur if the moon was actually colonized. I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is a money grab involved. There are some fantastic twists and turns as we figure out more about what is going on. 







I hung on to every word of this story. It was sarcastic, funny, smart, witty, and all the things I ever want out of a fully developed character. She makes mistakes, blames others, swindles people, drinks too much, and loves her dad more than she's willing to admit to herself. She's amazing and I want to read more stories with her in it.







I might be keeping this one on my shelf for a long time.







Up Next: _The Stand_ .... maybe
