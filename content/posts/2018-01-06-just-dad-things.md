Being a dad is a magical thing. You never truly feel rested from anything but at the same time you find some kind of strange energy that keeps you moving and enjoying everything. I woke up this morning to find my son downstairs with him mom putting those little spongy GROW capsules in a bowl of water and being mystified at how they grow. He's talking up a storm now and listening to him talk about what the animals were, how they were growing, and how the gooey capsule part was still stuck to them. Listening to my 2 1/2 year old talk say "alligator" and "stegasaurus" is still my favorite thing. I'm amazed at how well he does it.

He's so smart. Everything he does is blowing my mind lately. The only thing I can't get him to do is build stuff with me, but that's apparently a normal thing and comes with time. He always wants to knock stuff over, but who could really blame him.

I totally get why people decide not to have kids, but I'm not sure what my life would look like if we had been those people. I always wanted kids, but wasn't quite sure why other than that's what you're supposed to do once you're married. Now I get it. I totally get it. It's the most joy I get in a day by miles. All we can hope to do at this point is try to be the best parents we can be. We'll make mistakes, he'll goof up here and there, but at the end of the day, we'll know we did everything we could to raise another good human.

Sitting here, writing in my blog, and listening to him play with toys is really the best thing I could ever hope for when starting my day.
