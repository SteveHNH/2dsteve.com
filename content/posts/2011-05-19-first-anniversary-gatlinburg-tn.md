"Holy crap, this is awesome!"

That's pretty much what I said when I walked into mine and Steph's cabin in the Smokies for our first annniversary. This place is incredible. I've got a ton of pictures I'm going to post because it simply wouldn't do it justice for me to sit here and describe everything. I honestly didn't know what to expect when we booked our cabin, but it truly is a home away from home. We walked in and, after shutting the alarm off, my mouth dropped open in amazement. New appliances, huge 55" Sony Bravia TV, pool table, hot tub, jacuzzi, BED WITH MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS! Ahh!

We went out yesterday to eat at the Old Mill Restaurant, which I now highly recommend. They had corn chowder that was absolutely to die for. It was all spicy and tasty. Wow. Pretty killer chicken & dumpings too. I have to say that I really feel at home on this vacation. For one thing, we have a home up in the mountains with a beautiful view, and or another thing, everything is so COUNTRY! It's all soul food, horses, cowboys, and everything else you consider southern. I'm loving this place.

Today we're going out shopping in Gatlinburg and hitting the Ripley's Aquarium. We booked tickets to Dixie Stampede for tomorrow, which I've never been to so this should be really excited.

Anyway, We're getting ready to leave so I'm just going to leave it at that. Totally looking forward to our day ahead!! Pictures coming soon!
