I recieved an email today from the good folks over at [b182.com](http://www.b182.com/) and got some pretty freakin' sweet news about Tom Delonge's new project. Apparently, it's going to be the greatest rock album ever released in all time. He said every song pushes the 7 minute mark and is so full of emotion and power that it puts both Blink 182 and Box Car Racer to shame. He's so crazy proud of it that he's saying it's like smushing U2, Pink Floyd, and The Police together but with him singing. It's awesome he's that proud of it and I'm looking forward to hearing it! You know I'll be first in line to buy the album. Here's a few quotes from the article:



<blockquote>"Right now, I'm a song and a half from finishing the greatest album of my career, and I swear it's going to be something that will compete with the greatest rock records of all time. Within two years, we'll be the biggest rock act in the world. There's never been a rock band from America that sounds like us. And I hope that what I just said raises more than a few eyebrows."</blockquote>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Like I said, there's never been a band from America that sounded like this. Pink Floyd, the Cure, the Police, U2, Coldplay — they all come from Europe — and this band, it has the conceptual depth of Pink Floyd, it has the anthemic architecture of U2 but it has the energy and youthful vibrancy of Blink. I'm freaking out," he laughed. "And I'm not saying this lightly. Every single person who's heard the music understands. If I ever had the chance in my life to do something on a whole different level from anything I've ever done before, this is it."</blockquote>


He's also apparently putting out a film along with the album. It's going to be a third CGI, a third documentary, and a third love story. He's definitely got a huge project going. As far as his relationship with Mark and Travis goes, here is what he had to say:



<blockquote>"I love Mark and Travis to death. They were my best friends in the world, and I miss them tremendously. At the end, our priorities were mad different, and I haven't spoke to them since [the hiatus]," he continued. "So instead of talking, I just made this album and this film. There's a story line that runs throughout it, it's autobiographical, I felt like I lost my two best friends, I lost the band I created, and I did it all for my family. And so I decided to write the album and make the movie about my life. But rather than sit there and whine, I used analogies about love and war, because that's what this whole thing was like. Playing music in the wake of the Blink thing was like finding love in the middle of a war zone."      </blockquote>



So that's the update on Tom Delonge! Apparently he just needed to be with his family and get his stuff together. I can't blame him. As long as he and Mark and Travis are all making music, then Blink lives on. Maybe not as a band, but as 3 guys making music.
