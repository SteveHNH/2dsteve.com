I should post more short stuff. Like random thoughts and junk. Ya'll like that stuff, right? Now that this is easy, I should just do it from time to time.

I got a little WiFi chip dealio called the ESP8266. I made an LED blink when I connected to a website through it. The possibilities are endless, but my imagination seems to need a little help coming up with a project. I'll tell you one thing, making an LED blink was pretty rad. 

You should buy one as well. Then you'll be as cool as me.

BOOYAH!
