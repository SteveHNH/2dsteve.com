"'Revenge of the Sith' is, quite simply, f***ing awesome"

Oh yes! I believe Kevin Smith when he speaks and right now I am overwhelmed with excitement to see this movie! Apparently, George Lucas invited him out to see the movie in an advanced screening and he loved it, just like Steven Spieldberg and Francis Ford Copolla did! Seems like Lucas is going to totally redeem himself with this one. [Check it out](http://viewaskew.com/news/sith/)! Careful, there are spoilers, I didn't read any of it but the first sentence.
