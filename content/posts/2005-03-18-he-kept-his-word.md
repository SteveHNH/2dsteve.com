[Patrick Norton](http://patricknorton.typepad.com/slamdance/) finally has something on the web.

For those of you who don't know, there was a deal going on between [Leo Laporte](http://www.leoville.com/), [Kevin Rose](http://www.kevinrose.com/), and [Patrick Norton](http://patricknorton.typepad.com/slamdance/) over Patrick having a blog by St. Patrick's Day. Well last night he finally created a blog and hopefully he'll keep it up. I always liked Patrick and was disappointed that he didn't have a blog or website for all of us TechTV loyalists to keep up with, but now he has [one](http://patricknorton.typepad.com/slamdance/)! Heck yeah!
