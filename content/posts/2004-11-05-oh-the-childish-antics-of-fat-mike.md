I would like to call all of your attention to the website [www.punkvoter.com](http://www.punkvoter.com). I can't help but sit back and laugh at how Fat Mike of NOFX spouts off at all of us "uneducated Rednecks". Its so great because he comes off as an uneducated Redneck himself! haha! WOO! It's hard for people to take you seriously when you have a vocabulary limited to random four letter words.
On another note, [www.conservativepunk.com](http://www.conservativepunk.com) has a "we win" post that you should all check out. Its good stuff.
