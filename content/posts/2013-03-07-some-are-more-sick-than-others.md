It's been a while since I've written in the good ol' blog here, but there's no way I'm going to let it go as long as I did before! That would be unforgivable at this point. Not after doing so much to catch up with everything my life. I have a handful of things to talk about tonight in quick succession, but I'm also slightly distracted by watching this show about the circus on Hulu. Hopefully I can write a paragraph or two before I get distracted and can't focus on what I'm doing.

I finally got a new laptop!! After a crazy long amount of time without one (for me anyway), I was finally able to find one that works. I ended up with a 13" Macbook Pro with Retina Display. I love this thing! I was able to find it refurbished as soon as the price dropped on new ones. It was only $1269 for the one I ended up with. It has everything I want in a laptop. It's a little short on storage (128GB) but I'm not too worried about that because I don't intend to really store a whole lot of things on it. I don't really want to put pictures, music or videos on it. It will mostly be for work and for browsing the internet. It will also handle on-the-go podcasting when Ash and I end up going to a con or something. I think it's going to be great. So far it's pretty much changed my life when it comes to work. My work laptop was garbage, so using this has really changed things.

I also got to go to Pine Knoll Shores, NC with Stephanie this past weekend! We wanted to have a little getaway so that we could just go be with each other and not be anywhere near home. She used to vacation at the Outer Banks when she was younger and always wanted to take me there. We had an amazing time! We got to eat at some great places that she used to go to when she was younger, and we were at the beach! I love the beach! I found a ton of epic seashells. I usually don't get into that stuff, but I had so much fun walking around on the beach picking up shells. Steph took tons of pictures of the birds out there too. There were seagulls and sandpipers all over the place. We only spent one day there, but the day we spent was fantastic. The downside was, like all of our vacations, that I got sick while we were there. I got a cold basically on THE day that we wanted to go out and play. I powered through but I'm still suffering from it today.

Then the bad news came. We got a call from Mama on Saturday that PawPaw was headed back to the hospital in an ambulance because he was dehydrated again. This was the second time in a week that he had been on a ride to the hospital and it looks like this will be his last trip there. They took him in on Saturday and by early Tuesday morning they had called all of the family in. They ended up taking him off the fluids due to his lungs filling up, and he's basically just on enough drugs to keep him comfortable right now. It's been a pretty tough week on my whole family. Not so much for me because I'm not there, but I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be. It's tough in general because I know my grandpa is in the hospital and won't be coming home. It's times like these that I wish we had had more opportunities to know him better. I would love to know him like my mom does. I'm really bothered that I don't have that close knit relationship with him that a lot of other people I know have with their grandparents. Some people basically have second parents in their grandparents, but mine were always so distant. It's no fault of their own or ours, we just weren't there because we couldn't be. We just didn't live close.

I just really want his last few days to be comfortable for him and for him to be able to be peaceful. I can't imagine how scared he must be just to go to sleep and not be sure if he'll wake up or not. I just keep praying for him to have some peace and for my family to be okay also. I know everything will be fine, but we just have to get through all of this.

Well, that blog post was all over the place. Maybe I can write more often so I don't have to cover as much random emotional ground. Eh, whatever. It's my blog and you basically just witnessed my stream of consciousness. Scary isn't it?
