I remember a few years ago when I stumbled upon this site and thought to myself, "What an awesome idea!" I didn't even realize how many people would start using the service, and begin telling their deepest, darkest secrets to complete strangers. I guess it's easy when you're anonymous, but you still know that you just told the whole world something you'd kept secret from everybody else. If you've never visited the site, then you should give it a try.

The reason I'm posting this is that the guy who runs the site has released 3 books full of these people's secrets. I just watched the video below and it is really moving. What I learn from this is that everybody hides something.  A lot of these are a little disturbing, but some of them inspire a lot of hope. Most people's secrets tend to be pretty dark, as everything happy is something they want to tell. I hope you like the video below as much as I did, and
check out [Post Secret](http://www.postsecret.com) sometime.
