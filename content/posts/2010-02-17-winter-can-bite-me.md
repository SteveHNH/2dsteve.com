It's been a long, hard, harsh Winter and I think I'm ready for it to die in a fire. Honestly, how much snow can one state get?! We had a mini-blizzard, then more snow on top of that, then maybe a day with light flurries, and today it was snowing like crazy on my way home from work. I would LOVE to be able to use the cruise control in my car again. That would be so very nice.

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/superman-in-the-sun.jpg)I think it hasn't stopped snowing for the last two weeks, and that really is enough to drive somebody crazy. I miss the sun. I think I know how Superman feels when the clouds block the Sun all day. I bet he gets to feeling sluggish at work as "mild mannered Clark Kent." This got me to thinking that maybe Superman would benefit from some Vitamin D supplements. Who knows? Maybe all he really needs is some good old fashioned Vitamin D, but he never put together the pieces. Maybe a supplement would make him even stronger than he is, or even manifest a new power that he didn't even know he had. Now that would be an interesting turn of events. I guess DC could turn him into some kind of health nut, but then again that would be a really screwed up thing to do to the Man o' Steel.

I've been taking some of those Vitamin D supplements for the last few days, and I think they are helping to cheer me up a bit. For those of you who aren't exactly "in the know," Vitamin D is what the sun delivers through its amazing rays that you absorb whenever you are out in it. It screws with your seratonin levels and can actually have a "cheering up" effect on you. I have no idea how much this stuff is helping, or if it's helping at all, but I'm not against the placebo effect. If my brain thinks it's working and therefore decides that I'm happier, then that works for me. I'm not that picky. I would really love to actually see the sun though. I miss it a lot. I think I remember it being yellow but I can't be sure. The sky is still blue isn't it?

So, yeah, I guess the point I'm trying to get to is that the Winter is bumming me out. I've had fairly stressful drives to work everyday due to the potential for ice, and it's dark by the time I get home. Even if the sun did come out I wouldn't get to see it because I work in an office with no windows. Crap, I'm making myself bummed again. I know the Winter is coming to an end soon, it's just not soon enough.
