Today marks the arrival of a new era in me taking pictures. I would call it photography but I put absolutely no amount of science into anything that I do when it comes to shooting still shots of stuff. Give me a video camera and it's a work of art, but with a still shot camera it's pretty much just me running around aimlessly hitting a button. Either way I think it's going to improve the pictures that I take. Here's a little more story.

My camera totally broke and I was forced into looking for something new. I looked at the Canon IS200 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3. These were the two that CNET gave the highest reviews to and thus were the only two that I put in the running to by my new camera of choice. The Canon had a bunch of features that I thought might be nice. It had image stabalization, facial recognition, burst photos, and a bunch of other things, but they were also things that the Panasonic had. I ended up picking the Panasonic Lumix because it seemed much more suited to an amateur photographer like myself. It's a quick point and shoot with very few complicated settings and it takes amazing pictures. I checked both cameras out on Flickr to see what other people pictures looked like and it was impossible to tell a difference. Canon had more bells and whistles but they were nothing that I needed.

So the Panasonic is it. It's a 10 Megapixel with a 12x optical zoom, image stabilization, facial recognition, excellent low light performace, and dozens of other awesome things that I can use. After taking my old junkie camera to take pictures of the place Steph and I are going to get married, I decided it was time to bite the bullet on this guy. It's great and I'm sure my pictures that I post here and elsewhere will look 10 times better just because of it.
