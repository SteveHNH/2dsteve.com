I finally rode horses again the other day after years of not riding. I actually forgot how much fun it would be, and I thought that I should just go out there and do it. My dad has two great horses that he keeps in our pasture, and I thought it was really just silly of me to have them this close by and not go out![](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2351/2272873993_b6f67c3d9c_m.jpg)
and ride them every once in a while. I actually really enjoyed it and hope to do it again sometime soon. There's just something about riding a horse that makes you feel good, and it had been so long since I'd done it that I'd forgotten that feeling.

We just rode to the end of the road my parents live on and back, but considering how sore one's butt can get after a while, that distance was perfect for me. I rode Buttons, which is the brown and white one we have, and he was the smoothest riding horse I've been on. He would get to this point where I couldn't even tell I was riding a horse! And we were going at a pretty good speed, or at least it felt like it. I had a good time and posted a couple of the pictures on my Flickr account along with a few from a month ago when me and Patrick were jamming.

Anyway, I just though I would share the joys of horse riding with you guys! Until next time!
