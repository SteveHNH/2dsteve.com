](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/harry-potter.jpg)I just finished the 7th and final Harry Potter book and I have to say that I am completely satisfied with the ending that J.K. Rowling has bestowed upon us all. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody because I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that haven't finished it yet, or maybe haven't even picked it up. I will say a few things about it so you might not want to read if you want to be completely clueless.

I will say that this book was a far cry from the normal flow of the other books. Hogwarts is barely mentioned until you get closer to the end of the book, and what's going on there is completely of no concern to our main heroes. I actually liked this approach because it broke from the usual way it goes. All of the books to this point have had similar themes about new Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers,  some random lacky that Voldemort uses to get closer to Harry, and the usual escape from the Dursley's. This one started different, stayed different, and then ended completely different. Well not totally, but I'm gonna let you guys figure that one out.

All in all, I found this book just as hard to put down as the other books were. I'm completely satisfied with how the author chose to end it and even more satisfied that I was half right about what I thought was going to happen to Harry at the end. It all made perfect sense. Anyway, I just wanted to throw some comments out there about what I thought about this book. Now I have a new challenge: to find a new series to cling onto for the next decade =P

If you guys have finished it, or are in the process of reading, let me know what you thought in the comments :)
