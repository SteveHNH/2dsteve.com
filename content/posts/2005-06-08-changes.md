I've finally decided to learn about the capabilities of this free web server that [atgig.com](http://www.atgig.com) offers and I've figured out quite a bit. They are supposed to implement MySQL and PHP...stuff...on their servers which opens quite a bit of options when it comes to making a website. I'm actually contemplating moving my blog over there and seeing how it goes. I'm not sure how it works yet so I'm going to take this opportunity to test out a new website/blog for NinjaMan Productions.

Yes that's right, I'm going to start another one. At least that is the plan right now. If I can gain enough interest from some people *cough* [Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) *cough*, then I'll consider starting up another one for some random stuff.

The whole reasoning behind the new site is that I love making stuff. Whether it be these blog entries, movies, music, or podcasting, it's all so fun to me! I'm so intrigued by the thought of making my own content that I want to actually give it a go and see how it ends up. I guess you could say that I've been really inspired by shows like [From the Shadows](http://fromtheshadows.tv), [The Scene](http://www.welcometothescene.com), [The Broken](http://www.thebroken.org), [TWiT](http://www.twit.tv), and [Systm](http://www.systm.org) to make my own content for people to see. You guys should watch/listen to all those shows because they'll help you understand what this whole revolution is that I keep rambling about. Independent media is on the rise and I want to be a part of it.

This whole area is really exciting for me so I'm going to give it a try. I've already got some plans in mind for a PodCast once me and[ Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) get all the technical aspects squared away. I don't want to make any promises, but look for NinjaMan Productions to launch sometime this month or next month. School is a pain right now, don't they know that I have these huge ambitions I can't take time out of to write a speech! Geez! ;)

And what would a blogpost be without a movie update. Unfortunately, encoding this movie is taking much longer than I wanted it to because DivX didn't want to encode it right. It was very jumpy and the audio was out of sync. So I'm doing it on my 1Ghz Powerbook (SLOOOW) and I'm encoding to the new H.264 format. By the way, Quicktime 7 is available on apple's site for Windows. It's a preview release so it's buggy. Back on track, the progress bar says 7 hours left, but it's said that for the past 3 hours so there is no telling how long this is going to take. Just bare with me. After this it goes to Stephanie for audio, then I repeat the process and then it comes to you guys. Oh Apple why didn't you go to Intel sooner! I'd have this done by now!! Anyway, I'll catch you guys later.
