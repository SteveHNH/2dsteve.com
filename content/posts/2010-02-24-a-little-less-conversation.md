I just watched 80's star [Dolph Lundgren sing an Elvis song and smash a bunch of stuff](http://www.break.com/usercontent/2010/2/23/dolph-lundgren-sings-elvis-smashes-stuff-1755156) on some crazy show. Where the hey has he been?!

So I started to neglect the blog again, but here I am to save this sinking ship and bring it back on course. Freaking Xbox is stealing my soul! So let me kick off this sucker. I love **Jeopardy!**

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/jeopardy-pic.jpg)Steph and I are constantly being told that we are an old, married couple and I'm starting to wonder if it's true. Now I'm not saying that we don't go out and have a blast, but we do have some "old people tendencies." One of the things that we constantly get harassed about is our love for the oldest block of television the world has ever known: Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune. Yes, we sit down on the couch, eat our dinner, and proceed to question answers with the rest of senior America. I don't know what it is about that show that gets me, but I just LOVE trivia and you just don't run into questions like these on a daily basis in your regular life. These answers can only be found at 7pm Eastern when all the 95 year old people are getting ready to fall asleep...or maybe it helps them fall asleep, I can't really decide. Actually, I don't think they need a whole lot of help O_o

I guess I honestly just feel smarter when I sit around and question the answers with my hero, Alex Trebek. I can go through an entire day without feeling an ounce of genius burst from my head, but when I look at those blue squares and I can keep up with the contestants, my ego is saved. Maybe that's what I do this for. I do it just to make myself feel a little better. There's nothing wrong with that is there? I'm 24 and I like to sit around and watch Jeopardy! I am not ashamed of how I spend my evening. I could be sitting around looking for the next place to score some hookers and blow, but that is NOT the case! I'm sitting with my amazing fiancee watching Jeopardy. I think that's something to be proud of.

Wow, this post is a rambling mess. I think the best thing I can do now is just put the keyboard away and find something else to do for a bit. For tomorrow, I promise a post with substance!
