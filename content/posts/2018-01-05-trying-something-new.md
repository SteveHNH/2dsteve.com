I'm considering a complete departure from social media, but without some sort of outlet in the form of the written word, I'm not sure I'll be able to handle the escape. The main thing is that I have thoughts that I want to put out there, but I don't necessarily want to contribute to the dumpster fire that is Twitter. I just recently came to this realization that both Twitter and Facebook will either tell me things I don't necessarily need to know or something just to get me riled up and angry about something else.

There's something about people just yelling into the void that is starting to make me nuts. No one is doing anything that is making a difference, but simply shouting into the mass of people that read Twitter makes them feel like they are contributing to the betterment of society. The worst part is that they are often preaching to the choir. We don't follow people that we don't have anything in common with, and they don't follow us, so who are we talking to?

Anyway, this blog might be the place that some of my more long-form ideas go to. Maybe even short form ideas, given that this blog is super easy to put stuff in. I'm kind of intrigued by this software and it's "no frills" way of allowing me to dump text onto the internet.

We'll see how this goes and maybe it'll be useful to me or someone else.
