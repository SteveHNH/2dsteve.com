Today I thought I would get something done. Not anything in particular, just something. But once again it was a Sunday where I just layed around and didn't do much of anything. I did manage to hook up a scanner (woopdeedoo) and drink 3 cans of Coca-Cola. Yep, that's about it. I'm in the mood to write something but I don't know what to write. I would write about tech news or something but I can't think of anything cool at the moment. I've really just been trying to find something creative to do all day. I'm in one of those creative moods.

Oh yeah! I did manage to level up my Tauren Hunter to level 11 and I got a pet! I'm talking about [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) if you just thought I'd lost my mind. That took a few hours off the day. I'm sick of Tauren quests though, they're too long and boring.

I also signed up for a [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com) account today. I'm interested to find out what a paid blogging service can do for me that [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) can't. So far I can't find anything special about it. I've got access to all kinds of features with [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) that I can't have with [TypePad](http://www.typepad.com) unless I pay 15 dollars a month. It just doesn't make sense to me. I've got a 30-day trial account over there but I doubt it will even keep my attention for 30 days. I really need to buy a domain name for this blog so you guys don't have to type in a stupid name anymore. I want a .com but all the good ones are taken. Ah well, I guess it's just not meant for me to have a cool .com.

I bought one of those [Moleskine](http://store.yahoo.com/moleskine/index.html) notebooks the other day. I had the intention of using it to write down important numbers and what not for work but I don't know if that's what I'll use it for. I don't know, it makes me want to write down thoughts and stuff. It was used by famous artists, man, how can I use it for telephone numbers. I should be writing philosophical statements and poems in this thing. Not using it as a day planner! Maybe I'll write stuff in it. I've got another journal book that I write songs in, but I haven't written one in over a year. Maybe I will use this thing as a personal journal of sorts. Well, whatever I use it for, it's very cool.

I've written too much. You guys stay cool!
