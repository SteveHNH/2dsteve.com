I need somewhere to store some files so people can download them. I want to start making short videos and making them accessible to people. Videos and pictures.  I can put pictures on here using Hello from home but the firewall at school wont' let me do it. So if any of you know of a good free web hosting or very very cheap webhosting place then let me know. Then I'll put videos on here to download, that would just be coooool! Later
