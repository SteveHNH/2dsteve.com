I missed blogging yesterday, but I'm going to have a whole post about why that happened. I do have something really good to talk about tonight, and it has to do with my status that I left the other day. I wanted to make sure I kept up with my blogging so I posted something minor and that got me by. I'm going to forgive myself for yesterday's missed blog because I have a totally legitimate excuse for it. What I want to write about now is the awesome time I had with our good friends Peyton and Josh.Â <!-- more -->

Peyton and Josh live in Bluefield, WV, which is nestled right across the border from Virginia. Which in my mind barely saves it from being classified as part of the dumbest state in the union. Right now I have a somewhat deep rooted disdain for VA, but I'll tell you all about that in a later post. Peyton is one of Stephanie's best friends from pharmacy school and Josh is her husband. These two people are two of my favorite people in the whole world. Whenever we hang out with them, we feel like we can just be ourselves, and never have to worry about anything. They are super fun, hilarious, and are both incredible story tellers. I honestly could listen to them tell crazy stories for days. Josh is absolutely full of them.

We met up with them at the Cheesecake Factory in Durham on their way to Wilmington, NC. They're going down there for vacation but decided to stay the night with us since they would be passing through here anyway. We sat around at Cheesecake Factory reminiscing and pretty much just catching up with what's been going on with everybody. It's awesome to have friends that you can just pick up where you left off with. That's what's awesome about being around them. I feel like even if we hadn't seen each other in months, we could still hang out and not have a single problem bringing up something to talk about. We ate some foot, talked, grabbed some cheesecake and then I showed Josh my epic new wallet, which I don't think I've talked about here yet.

The wallet is magical. It's more of a money clip/card holder than anything, but it close up with these four straps. The cool thing about it is that you can just put stuff in between the folds, and the next time you open it up, the straps grab the money/reciept/card and hold it in. IT's amazing to watch! I showed this thing to Josh and he immediately needed one. I told him there was a Fossil that carried them in the mall, so we took off out of the restaurant and ran over to the mall. To his disappointment, we were heading in just as all the stores were closing. SAD FACE. He was all bummed, but at least he knows it's out there and he can go get one anytime he wants. I'm just glad I could show him how cool it was.

After that we came back here and sat around some more talking about the logistics of putting a urinal in your bathroom at home just for convenience. Josh truly believes in this idea, where I think most people in the room weren't exactly into it. We also had a really fun conversation about how long oval shaped toilets are better than round toilets, especially if you're a guy. It was hilarious. Peyton's reactions to all this stuff was the funniest thing I've seen. It was utter amazement every time one of the dudes would explain why doing a certain thing was important to us. Guys and girls are different is basically what it all came down too, but we had so much fun talking about it all. I love those people and I can't wait to see them again. Hopefully they can come back for longer or we can go visit them for a weekend or something. I truly enjoy their company so much.

In other news, I finished "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" today. That was an awesome book. It really captured growing up and being in high school so well. Not to mention it actually had a good kid as the main character and not some jerk that was doing all the wrong things. It felt real, and I loved the way it was all presented. The main character, Charlie, was basically writing letters to an anonymous person about his life all year in high school. It felt personal and real. I loved every bit of it and it has a bit of a surprise ending also. I won't spoil anything. I highly recommend it to people who enjoy a book that isn't full of dragons and conspiracies. This is a book about life in general. I'm going to get Steph to watch the movie with me as soon as it hits iTunes or Netflix.

Marking it off the list and starting "The Name of the Wind" by Patrick Rothfuss. Apparently this book is supposed to be amazing fantasy. I'm pretty excited to get into it. The first few chapters have been awesome. I really need to read more :).

That's it for now. I have another big post coming up tomorrow probably. I need to get one out there anyway, and I feel like trying to cram it in here would be too much.
