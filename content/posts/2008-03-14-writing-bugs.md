I've got the writing bug again, although I have to admit that it's not exactly for this blog. Don't get me wrong, I love writing in it. I just have a bug to write another screenplay. I blogged about writing a movie a long time ago and that didn't turn out too bad at all. I know it wasn't "incredible" but it was a scary movie that I made with my friends. I loved writing it, making it, and watching it. I really just wish I had a done a few things different, but for the most part, it was awesome!

Anyway, I've got this awesome screen writing software that makes me want to write something. I've got an idea for a 1940's noir film, but I don't know where to start it. I guess I really don't have much a plot at all, but I do have some characters. My buddy Lando wrote a detective story a while back that was awesome and it had some really cool three dimensional characters in it. He has a real talent for making characters come to life and really become people you care about. He should write another cool story that I can adapt.

I thought I would just ramble for a minute because I haven't written anything in a while. I'll let you guys know if I actually write anything...though you know me pretty well by now and have discovered that I have a lot ideas but hardly ever act on them for very long. I need to get better at that. Later!
