I said to myself this morning, "Self, you should write in your blog because you're going to be gone for a week," to which I responded, "You're right! I'll do that!" So here I am to write in my blog for a bit.

I'm leaving to head to Port Canaveral today so me and Stephanie, my lovely fianc√©, can get on our boat tomorrow morning and head for the bahamas! I'm so excited. I've never been on a cruise before but all my friends tell me that it's awesome. I'm just looking forward to relaxing and spending an awesome vacation with Stephanie. We've never had a chance just to be together without friends or family calling all the time. Not that I don't love hearing from friends and family, but every so often you just need a chance to be alone.

I've heard of a lot of things to do on this boat. Most importantly the all you can eat pizza! I'm probably going to eat until I explode. I also want to take Stephanie dancing one night because she really likes to do that. I've never been into that sort of thing, but we should have a lot of fun and I'm going to try to loosen up a bit and not worry about anybody else. I'm kind of nervous anyway because I'm a sucky dancer. We'll see how all that goes!

We also have a couple shore excursions we're going to do. We're going to snorkel in Freeport and go on a freakin' awesome Pirate Tour in Nassau! Aside from that, we're just going to wander around aimlessly and get into trouble. It should be lot of fun. I'm just glad I don't have to think about anything for a week. No cell phone, internet, work...it's awesome. I just get to relax and do absolutely nothing for a bit.

I'll catch you guys later then. I just wanted to get a blog post out before I went on my trip. I know I'm a slacker and don't blog enough, but I'll try to get better at that. I've just been so busy with work, [Horseshoes & Hand Grenades](http://www.horseshoes-handgrenades.com), [Pi and CHiPS](http://www.piandchips.com/podcast), and everything else. So you guys take it easy and be cool. Later!
