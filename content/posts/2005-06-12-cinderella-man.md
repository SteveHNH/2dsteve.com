I just got back from seeing [Cinderella Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352248/) and all I have to say is "Wow"! This movie was so good. I really don't know what to say about it other than everybody should see it. If you are a fan of true stories, if you liked [Big Fish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/) or [Forrest Gump](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109830/), then this is a movie for you. It's not a boxing movie at all, it's a movie about a boxer. Granted there are lots boxing scenes in it and boy are they instense, but it's more about a man trying to fight for something. It's more about fighting the "invisible hits" (the Great Depression) than it is about fighting the other guy in the ring. This is the story about a guy who is down and out then comes back with the sole purpose of keeping food on the table for his wife and kids. So go see this movie. It was brilliant.

In other news, the [podcast](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/podcast) is going to be released tonight around 10 or 11 depending on how late I'm up. I would put it out at midnight but I have to get up at 6 in the morning. So if you want it, just subscribe to [the feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/steveandlando) with [iPodder](http://ipodder.sourceforge.net) and it will be there when you wake up in the morning. You have to leave iPodder running through the night, but it just puts a little icon in your system tray, you hardly notice it. So be ready!
