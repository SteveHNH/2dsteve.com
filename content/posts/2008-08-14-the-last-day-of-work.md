Well, it's official! I just completed my last day of work as an employee of the Florida Department of Corrections. It was a very emotional day and I can't even express how much I'm going to miss my co-workers. These people have been my family for the past 3 years, and words can't even convey how much of a great experience I've had working with them. I didn't get to say goodbye to everybody the way I wanted to, but I left a note on my white board in my office that I hope most people will get to see.

I was really touched by how many people said they enjoyed me being there for the past few years. I know I talked to some people more than I talked to others, but everybody has had an affect on me. I'll carry the skills I've learned in this job onto my others and I hope that I can always live up to the expectations they have of me. Everybody there believes that I'm doing the right thing and are behind me 100%. It really means a lot and I tried to make sure they knew that before I left.

As of right now, I'm unemployed and ready to roll to my new home in West Virginia. Most importantly, I finally am closing the distance gap between Steph and I. I've been writing about this for years, and I can't believe it's finally happenning. I'm getting all teary eyed just typing up this blog post. I've spent the last five years of my life missing her and wishing I could be with her. For it to finally happen just feels like a dream come true. My heart just swells up thinking about it.

This next chapter of my life is going to be very exciting, and I can't wait to start it up. I am going to miss everyone here SO much though, and I really started to feel that today as I left work for the last time. Everyone in Tallahassee has had such a great impact on my life and the way I look at things. I've met some of the greatest people I've ever known and I pray that I don't lose touch with them. In this age of the internet, there really isn't much of an excuse for it!

On Friday, I will be making the epic journey north to where my future lies. That future is with Stephanie, the way it should be. I'll let you know what happens!
