I have some terrific news! Once again found at the wonderful [Joey The Intern](http://www.joeytheintern.com/blog) site! Apparently Micro$oft is out to start up a new TechTV channel in the 3rd Quarter of 2005. I really really like this news because it means that there is hope! The creator of TechTV, Paul Allen, was one of the co-founders of Micro$oft which means that we could possibly have our tech back! Yes, Excitement flows through me right now at 8:51 am.
The only thing that worries me about this is that M$ hates all things open-source and all things firefox, so does this mean that M$ will control the type of content played on their channel. I sure hope not. I think that they wouldn't be stupid enough to dictate what they say on there, but you never know. To say that IE is the best browser, or that Linux is the worst operating system ever is a downright lie and I think they know it. They aren't geeks at M$, they are businessmen. Businessmen will do anything to crush the competition, hence M$ stealing ideas from everyone else rather than being innovative. Watch Pirates of Silicon Valley man, that movie explains a lot.
Just thought I would let you guys know that we could be seeing MSTechTV near the end of next year, WOOOHOOO! Anything is better than G4!
