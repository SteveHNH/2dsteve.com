I found a really nifty download today for those of you who want to get the look and feel of [Mac OS X ](http://osx.apple.com)on your windows machine. It's called [FlyAKiteOSX](http://osx.portraitofakite.com). It totally changes nearly every aspect of your User Interface and makes it look more like OS X. It even turns your bootup screen into the gray screen that a Mac uses. The great thing about it is, you get to decide what parts of your machine it changes, and set a system restore point so you can get the most out of it. I used the icons, wallpaper, and cursors and my machine looks pretty sweet. So you can go download that and see what you think. If you don't like it all you have to do is run the uninstall program and it totally reverts back to what you had before, no hassle. Give it a try!

There is also another program for your OS X transformation needs called [ObjectDock](http://www.objectdock.com). This places a dock on the bottom of your screen just like the one on OS X that bubbles up and stuff whenever you mouse over the icons. It's all cool and stuff. You can check that out here, and then get some icons and stuff over at [wincustomize](http://www.wincustomize.com).
