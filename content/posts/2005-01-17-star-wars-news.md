I don't know if I've mentioned this before, but I am slightly star wars obsessed. I found these articles that just prove that I am not alone.

Somebody managed to build an actual "[Sandcrawler](http://www.jalopnik.com/cars/novelties/who-put-the-donk-in-the-jl421-badonkadonk-029757.php)" as seen in Episode IV! Its awesome! Its smaller than the real one, obviously, but its still awesome. I'd drive it. For those of you who don't know, it's the machine that the jawas drive around near the beginning of the movie.
After looking at it for a second though, it looks more like Jabba's cruise ship type deal from Episode VI....I think [the place I got the article from](http://slashdot.org) was kind of confused.

Also, there is a [guy in Seattle](http://waitingforstarwars.blogspot.com) who has already started waiting in line for Episode III : Revenge of the Sith. He's got a [blog](http://waitingforstarwars.blogspot.com) all about his long, 5 month wait. If I wasn't in school, and I had nothing better to do, I might wait a couple weeks before just for fun, but I have a life. 5 months is a tad extreme, but I hope this guy has fun.
