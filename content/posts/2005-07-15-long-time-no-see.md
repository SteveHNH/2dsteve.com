Whoa! It's been so long since I've posted...or at least I feel like it has. I've been so busy will all kinds of other stuff and it just didn't seem like I had that much important to say. Not that I have much important to say right now but at least I do feel like sharing my world with the...well...the world.

I'm sitting here right now listening to [JamisonParker](http://www.purevolume.com/jamisonparker). This band is seriously awesome and I think you should all go to their pure volume page and listen to them right now. I thought that I was excited about the new [Rufio](http://www.purevolume.com/rufio) cd but I think I'm more excited about JamisonParker now becuase it's awesome. It's very passionate and I like passionate stuff.

I've also joined the world of wireless internet now! I talked about it on the podcast a little and yesterday was the day that I set it up. I love it! It took a little while to set it up because of some DHCP confusion, but I got it after some tweaking. Now my mom's computer, sister's computer, and one laptop are all using wireless internet. It's so awesome not to have to carry around a 50 foot cable everywhere. I'm now happily bathing in WiFi signals...it's awesome.

Me and [Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) are getting really good at this podcast thing. I don't mean to sound conceded (I call it confident) but we are seriously awesome. If you haven't listened yet, cruise over to [www.steveandlando.com](http://www.steveandlando.com) to check it out. We recently changed up our format a little to include more of everything outside of the tech world and shorten the show a bit. Each show we'll aim for a half hour, but sometimes we go over a tad. Either way the show has taken a much more entertaining turn so subscribe to the feed.

I got called for an interview today and I'm totally excited about it. I hope I get the job. It involves working on computers but that's about all I know about it at the moment. I guess I'll find out more when I go to the interview.

Anyway, that's it for Steve's Life today. I'll catch you guys later. I'll try to post more often. Things have calmed down around here a little bit.
