Hey Everybody! I just wanted to make a quick post so that you guys could have first dibs on a pretty snazzy laptop. I'm selling my 15" Powerbook G4 on eBay! It's not too bad of a laptop, minus a bad battery and a couple cosmetic issues. I started the bidding at $350 because I'm throwing in some software that did cost me a bit when I bought it. Anyway, just check out my ebay listing and decide if you wan to buy it. It's going to help me pay for my new one, and it's honestly not a bad laptop at all. It's definitely good if you want to find out how Mac OS X runs and learn a bit about it. It's perfectly functional too. So go look and bid!
