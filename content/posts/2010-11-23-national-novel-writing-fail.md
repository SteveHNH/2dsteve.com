Another year goes by and I've got no novel to speak of. I tried pretty hard to come up with something, and I even got started, but my story lacked substance. I really wanted to write an adventure and it all went downhill. My characters weren't interesting, the conversation in the story was dull, and I really didn't have a good way to fix it. I guess I could have put a little more into it, but I really didn't have a passion for my own story and I didn't have time to commit to it. I need to isolate myself in a cabin to come up with a good story and the just write it. One of these days I'll eventually come up with something I love so much that I can't stop writing it.

Aside from completely screwing up NaNoWriMo, this has been a pretty decent month. Steph and I bought our first Christmas tree yesterday! It's a six foot candian fur...a fake canadian fur. It was super cheap, but we're really proud of it. Now all we have to do is start gathering some ornaments to go on it.

Well...I just got a long call from my awesome parents and forgot all the things I was going to write about. That's cool though! My parents are awesome and it was nice to talk to them. I got Christmas ideas!! Woot!

Until next time, earthlings!
