I cannot believe that I haven't sat down to type in this blog for over 4 months! I'm a sad individual. I totally blame [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) for my absence from the blog-o-sphere. It's become so easy to let the world know what you are doing multiple times throughout the day, and make it feel like you really don't need a long form blog post to deliver your thoughts. I never intended to use [Twitter ](http://www.twitter.com)to replace my blog but I guess I inadvertently did it anyway. Most of the stuff I say on my [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) account is just a nice short form way of saying something I would say on my blog, but that's just not going to do it. So here I am writing something in my blog so I can try to get back in the groove.

I don't even know where to start but here it goes.

Steph and I have FINALLY picked a wedding date for us to get married. It's about time if you ask me! We found out that her pharmacy rotations will start at the beginning of June so we have some time in May to get hitched. We're planning on getting married on **May 15, 2010**. So keep that date in mind! I'm probably going to be streaming the whole thing live over the internet on Ustream.tv for my family and friends who can't make it. Hopefully the venue we pick will have the ability for me to do this. I'm sure I'll find a way regardless. I will NOT however plan the wedding around my intention to stream it. If we can do it, great, if we can't, well that's just the way it is.

Now the important stuff starts with this whole wedding deal. We have to get a preacher, get a place, start talking about cake, and deciding who to invite and who to skip. This is probably going to be a lot more stressful and confusing that I think it will be, but I'm so excited I don't even know how to express it. We've been waiting for this for so long, and it's great to finally see something come to fruition. We have a bunch of ideas. One of our big goals is to make this as exciting and fun for the people coming as it is for us. We've officially changed the name of our "reception" to the "after party." It sounds so much more exciting that way! Reception sounds so....refined. Our wedding ceremony will be really traditional, but after that it's party time!

This is a short blog post to just to catch you up on a couple of things. I'm probably going to be redoing this site in the near future and making it a little more fun. I'll do more to pump some content into this sucker. I've got to get more motivated for it, but I think I can make it something that you guys will enjoy. Once again, I cannot stand that I have a 4 month gap in my blog posts. That's just sad. Later!
