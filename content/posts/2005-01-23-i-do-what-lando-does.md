I am a staple in almost everyone's diet. Friends like me are a complement to any other friends I get on with almost everyone, remaining mostly in the background, but providing substance when it would otherwise be lacking. [What Flavour Are You?](http://quiz.ravenblack.net/flavour.pl)

I am a drifter. I go where life leads, which makes me usually a very calm and content sort of person. That or thoroughly apathetic. Usually I keep on doing whatever I'm doing, and it takes something special to make me change my mind. [What Video Game Character Are You?](http://quiz.ravenblack.net/videogame.pl)

The hat of the adventurous, I am spontaneous and active, perhaps sometimes a little foolishly. Regardless, I always come out alright. [What Sort of Hat Are You?](http://quiz.ravenblack.net/hat.pl)
