For once, I might actually be happy with something Microsoft does.

Microsoft as decided to begin treating Sony's Rootkit as malware and will be providing removal tools for the software. It's going to be included in their monthly "Malicious Software Removal Tool" that we all get through windows update and their AntiSpyware Beta.

I'm really excited about this because it's two 300 pound gorilla's fighting over something. Both of these companies are clearly at the top of the food chain in their respective areas so it's fun to watch them fight each other. I laugh at Sony and their feable efforts to encroach on Microsoft's territory. At least Microsoft can protect us from the well known bugs, worms, and viruses. If only they could figure out how to protect us from themselves.
