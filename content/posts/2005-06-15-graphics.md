I would like to take this post to think the beautiful and multitalented Stephanie for making [Steve and Lando's On The Go Web Show](http://steveandlando.blogspot.com/) some sweet graphics! I'm so happy with how these turned out and she has completely met all my expectations. Thank you so much Stephanie!

I'm gonna post one of these every day just because I don't like posting tons of crap all at once. Here's the first one, which we'll use for the main logo, at least at the moment. These things always change with time.
