I have had probably the most uneventful Memorial Day weekend of my entire life, but at the same time a few really cool things did happen. Most of the weekend was super boring though and I really should have gone to WV to visit Stephanie. She was in Virginia on vacation for a couple days of it though, so it really just would have been a lot of driving and a little visit. It still would have been nice though, and I wouldn't have spent my three day weekend moping around.

I did do a couple fun things however and those more than make up for the boring times. I got a killer deal on a brand new LG 42" LCD HDTV. It's incredible! I didn't know what I was missing when it came to HD programming and all that jazz. The TV was $999 at Circuit City and the financing plan has no interest until 2011. I can pretty much take my time paying this thing off, though knowing me I'll have it paid off in a few months just so I don't have that hanging over my head. The TV does 1080p, which is awesome and Circuit City even gave me three free Blu-ray movies...the only bad part about that is that I don't get to watch them because I don't have a Blu-ray player! PS3 here I come....though I am very sad to say it. I was an HD-DVD fan all the way.

I also got to go see Indiana Jones IV for the second time this weekend and it was even better! I didn't write an initial review of the movie which would have been slightly less exciting as my second review. I guess it just takes seeing it a couple of times to totally enjoy it. The thing that shocked me the most was the 1950's era stuff. I liked it for the most part, I just wasn't expecting the sci-fi spin on everything. Apparently George Lucas thought that this movie should feel like the sci-fi B movies of the 50's. It did that, but it did it with a very Indiana Jones flair. I liked the movie the first time I saw it, but I LOVED it the second time around.

Well, I don't have much else to say. I know that I need to start writing in this thing more, because I really do enjoy it. I guess it's the motivation to write that gets me the most. Once I start writing I really enjoy it and find lots of things to say. But I'll cut it off here and let you guys get back to your lives. Take it easy!
