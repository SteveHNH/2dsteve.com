Brace yourselves, ye faithful visitors. I have a crapload of things to say because I'm in one of those rare moods to write. Most of it involves the same stuff, but I just can't tell enough people how excited I am about a bunch of cool stuff. It may seem silly, but I don't do too much and I have an obsessive personality...so here are my current obsessions.

Vintage 1920-40'sÂ  stuff:[![img_0481.jpg](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/img_0481.thumbnail.jpg)

I'm crazy excited about a hat that I'm getting for Christmas. It's a fedora.... you know, like the hat Indiana Jones wore. I figure that's the most recognizable fedora ever made. Well anyway, it's a grey Akubra Federation. It's a very popular hat due to it's tall crown and very distinguished look. I can't wait to get it. I'm a little skiddish about wearing it out in the public, mostly because they just aren't seen that often now, so it garners much more attention than it should. But, I've been talking to these guys at this forum called [The Fedora Lounge](http://www.thefedoralounge.com). They seem to have thought the same thing when they bought their first hats, but got over it quickly and said it's weird when they don't have it now. Apparently, most people admire the hat, and the people you really shouldn't care about are the ones with all the stupid comments. Either way, I'm excited and can't wait to pick it up!

[Netflix](http://www.netflix.com):
I also just subscribed to Netflix again. It's something that I had a long time ago, but it wasn't nearly as efficient then as it is now. I've watched a couple old movies using their online player, and I just recieved my first 3 today (Reign Over Me, Blood Diamond, Die Hard). I'm trying to figure out how to put an RSS feed on the side of my page with the movies I currently have at home. Netflix is actually one of the best applications of Web 2.o type stuff I've seen in a major company. I'm not used to these big name places actually having really good technology running their backend. They provide you with RSS feeds to all of your stuff, a community, and there is Ajax awesomeness all over the place. Another thing that they have that works really well is the recommendation feature. I was really surprised at how well it chose movies for me. It really does a good job of defining what kind of taste a person has and suggesting movies accordingly. I'm all around impressed with it.

Well, after all that, there's not much else for me to say. I'll post my reviews of a couple of movies tomorrow hopefully. I watched Casablanca and Reign Over Me. Both of them were awesome, but I can tell you more about those later. You guys stay cool!
