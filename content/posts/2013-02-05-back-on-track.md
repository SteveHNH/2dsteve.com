For the first time in years, I am below 200 pounds! Yep, you read that right. I have eaten healthier for nearly two weeks and the reward is a 198 pound body that I'm hauling around. It's not a lot, but I really thought I was pretty much stuck at 200 pounds no matter what I did. I'm really proud of myself. I stood on that scale this morning not sure what to expect, and then BAM! The cool thing is that seeing it's possible has motivated me a bit more. I lost about 5 pounds over the course of a month, which is no big thing, but I haven't been exercising well either. I should be, but I'm taking some baby steps. Getting my diet on track has been a challenge, but my incredible wife has made it possible.<!-- more -->

I'm glad I got to wake up Monday to some awesome news, because this weekend just wasn't that much fun at all. I had a "butt problem" to deal with. Which is mine and my dad's way of saying hemmorhoid. I've battled back and forth over whether I should actually blog about this,but I really don't care. At the end of the day, this is a record of the goings-on in my life and I don't really feel like censoring it all that much. So I woke up last Thursday with a "butt problem" and I thought I was taking good care of it over the next two days, but I knew it wasn't excellent. I make it to the weekend and it was still being a pretty stupid problem so I vowed to chain myself to the couch (figuratively) and not move until Monday. I basically spent the whole weekend in my pajamas attempting to recover from this crap.

I'm still not 100% today, but I'm not in any pain. That's the best news I have to offer. The problem still exists, but it's shrinking back down steadily and I'm making my way to a full recovery. This is just another one of those curses that I've been gifted with in my family genes. I have high cholesterol, butt problems, I was born with a short tongue, I was missing two teeth when I was born that had to be added, and I'm pretty sure there are some other hidden secrets that I'll find as I grow older. The good news is that my mom was sweet enough to hand me down a full head of hair! So though my hairline has receded a bit, I think I'll still have it for a while. I'm pretty fond of my hair so that's a good thing. I think I can deal with the other things.

This post is a tad short, and I'm bothered that I missed the weekend, but given the circumstances, I think I can have a pass. Actually, IÂ _am_ going to give myself a pass on this one. A butt problem is nothing to play with, so I'll just let this one go. I'm back on track now though. Let's do February!
