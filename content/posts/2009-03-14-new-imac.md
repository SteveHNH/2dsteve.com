](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/cimg2205.jpg)I finally have fulfilled one of my very simple dreams, and that is to own an iMac. I ordered it a couple days ago after finding one that was MUCH cheaper than a new one. Yes, I got a refurbished one, but it works just the same and went through all the same tests that Apple does on their new products. So there! As most of you know, Apple refreshed their entire desktop line last week, which is what I was waiting for before buying one. I was actually kind of disappointed in what happened to the iMacs though. They basically experienced a slight price drop and the shipping specs were changed up a bit. The high end 3.06 Ghz iMac now ships with 1 TB of storage and 4GB of RAM standard, and it also has an nVidia GT 130 512MB video card. These are things that looked nice, but I don't know if they were nice enough to justify paying a bunch extra for.

I just happened to take a look at Apple's refurbished section and found this little beauty in there. It's the same high end model that I wanted but it's a little less beefy. It uses the same processor and RAM as the new one, but it only came with 500 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM, and an nVideo 8800 GS 512 MB video card. I think that's just fine for what I want to do with it. I really don't NEED 1 TB of storage and I can upgrade the RAM for super cheap anyway. So this made sense to me. I ended up getting the machine for $500 cheaper than if I had bought a brand new one.

I'm LOVING this machine. It's exactly what I was looking for. It's fast, pretty, and it's a Mac!! I've always wanted a Mac desktop since I got the laptop and fell in love with the operating system. I thought that this screen might be a little much at 24", but it's just right. I definitely wouldn't get anything bigger lest my eyes fall out of my head from staring at it too long. The best thing about the whole process was that I was able to migrate all the applications, documents, and settings from my laptop to this computer by using the Time Machine backup I had of my Macbook. It was crazy simple! I really couldn't believe it. It only took about an hour to get everything moved over, and I have a lot of crap.

Anyway, I'm going to be tinkering around with this thing for a while it seems, and might even be playing a little bit of WoW while I'm at it ;).
