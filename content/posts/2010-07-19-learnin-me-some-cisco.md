I arrived in our nation's capital for the second time in my life today so that I can go get trained on switches and routers. I've been wanting to go to one of these CCNA boot camps for a really long time and I finally got theh opportunity, so here I am. The place we're staying at is pretty snazzy, and by "the place" I mean the surrounding area. The hotel is all right and all, it's just a normal hotel like any other.

We're staying in Tyson's Corner, which is a place outside of DC that I wasn't able to see last time I was here. There is a ton of stuff over here. There' s an AMC, IMAX, Barnes & Nobles, and a snazzy looking Borders. I didn't even know that all of this was here. I won't have any time to see it, but it sure looks cool when you're driving through it. The traffic is ridiculous though, so I don't really have a chance to look around or I may slam into the person in front of me. That's no good at all.

My training is also down in the middle of downtown DC, so it's a little rough to get to. I drove it today though and I pretty much figured out what lane I needed to be in. That's half the battle really. Anytime I go to a new place, I usually look at the Google maps satellite stuff so that I can tell what the roads really look like so I have a better idea of where I need to be. I don't like being completely surprised.

The training itself is going to be from 8 to 8 everyday, so my brain very well may explode. It's going to be awesome though because I'm super interested in what I'm learning about. Plus I may very well get a certification when I come out of this. I say "may", but I mean "will" because it's not really an option. I WILL be CCNA certified at the end :). Woo!
