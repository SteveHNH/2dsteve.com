I'm just sitting around waiting for Steph to call so I figured I would write a thing or two in this here weblog. I hope everyone is having a fantastic day.

I absolutely LOVE podcasting. It constantly amazes me that someone can put content out in the world that others will listen to. There is so much more power in the people's hands than their used to be. There was a time when you had to have a job at a radio station to say stuff an even then it was dictated by some overlord with a kill switch. Now, you, me, jimmy down the street, anyone can have a show and tell people whatever they want. Blows my mind.

I've always loved talking to people, entertaining people, and all in all just trying to make everyone have a good time. Sometimes I think it's my true calling. Just being there and giving people some break from the craziness they deal with everyday. I think of some of our listeners who have sent us emails or let us know that our show has really helped them get through tough times, or just brought a smile to their faces on days when they just didn't feel that great. It means so much to me to know that Ash and I have that kind of effect on people. I love knowing that our show means something to people and they really do appreciate us. I know we really appreciate them.

I know we aren't the best at getting back to every person or emailing everybody back. I'm the world's worst at remembering what I said I'll put on the show and what I won't. A lot of the time I'll get an email from a listener and have every intention to add their story to the show notes and I completely forget by the time showtime rolls around. I really need to take more notes on EVERYTHING throughout the day. That would probably help me out just a little bit :P

Anyway, I'm sitting around listening to some old Ataris albums and just being altogether bored. Steph should be calling soon so I'm just going to leave it at this or I could type all night. Have a great evening everybody!
