](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/photo-6.jpg)I bought this snow hat the other day! It's awesome, and completely ridiculous! Snowboard trip is this weekend, and I can't even tell you how excited I am. My buddies from Florida are coming up to Snowshoe so we can go. I've never been before but I know I'm going to love it. I used to skateboard all the time and I figure that snowboarding is just a natural extension of that. I know it has a learning curve, but Matt was telling me that I should pick it up relatively fast. We'll see how it goes.

We're going on Thursday night and will be staying until Sunday afternoon. That should allow us to get a few good days of boarding in. I think the weather is supposed to be snowy too so we don't have to worry about them using the fake snow and making the mountain hard as a rock instead of soft and puffy. I'm pretty sure my legs are going to hate me when we're done going down these hills, but they'll get over it. At least I'll have fun while my legs are getting a workout!
