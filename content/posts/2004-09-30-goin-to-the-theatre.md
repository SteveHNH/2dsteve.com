A Funny Thing Happened On the Way to the Forum


Oh boy! Another show tonight! This whole theatre thing is really awesome. I've really enjoyed being a light board operator. I didn't think it would be this fun, and it wasn't to begin with but I've met some super cool people working out there. Alas, nobody plays bass...but thats okay! It's a really good show too which helps a lot. I've got to go tonight and I find myself pretty much counting the minutes til I have to leave. I'm looking forward to it now. The drive kind of sucks because its lik 45 minutes. That's too far for anyone to drive 4 times a day. I spend about 3 hours on the road 3 days out of a week while working on this show. Its fun, but strenuous. The actors are all so cool too! Everybody's just so nice haha! Well I'm getting ready to leave but if you want to see pictures of the show [Click Here.](http://susanstripling.com/proofing/092104_forum_sp/)
