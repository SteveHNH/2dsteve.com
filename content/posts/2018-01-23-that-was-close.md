I'm almost 100% certain that I just ran into Dave Gardner from the Double Fine Adventure documentary at my local coffee shop. He was an animator on Broken Age, and a pretty cool dude, at least as far as I could tell. I was too chicken to say hello and tell him I loved the game. Oh well! Maybe next time.

It's a small world.
