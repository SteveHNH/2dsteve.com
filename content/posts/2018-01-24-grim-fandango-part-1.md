I started the Grim Fandango stream last night! I forgot how much I really loved this game. I thought I might get bored of the dialogue, or want to just get the puzzles over with, but I'm really enjoying walking around in the world. I'm so glad I decided to stream this. I think everyone else was having a good time as well.
