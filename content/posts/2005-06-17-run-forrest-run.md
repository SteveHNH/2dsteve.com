I seriously need a new computer chair because this one is driving me nuts! I sit on my rear so much during the day that I can't just have any computer chair. I need one of those elite computer chairs with the vibration and what not. Okay, maybe I don't need anything to crazy, but I would like a nice high back chair. The one I've got is just your average computer chair: no arm rests, comes up to my back, and sadly the cushion is gone. I swear that this thing used to be really comfortable but now I can feel my butt eroding as I sit here.

Some have suggested standing up, or even exercise! Exercise! Who do they think I am?! Ha! Really, I'm not against exercise. In fact, I love to get up and run every now and then. I am by no means..husky.. but I guess I could use some more "get up and go". Exercise is important to anybody's daily computer use. So if you have been sitting down for more than 2 hours, get up and give your rear a rest. Don't end up like me with your butt as flat as a hardwood floor. Go excercise! It's swell!

...on second thought, I really just would like a new chair.
