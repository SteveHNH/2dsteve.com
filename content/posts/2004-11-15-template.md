I seriously hate bloggers templates now. I can find nothing that screams "I'm Cool!"
So I have reverted back to my old template simply because I was beginning to not like the other one. This one is very plain but its cool. I suppose that I'll change someday when they get more templates. If any of you know of anywhere you can find cool blogger templates let me know. Later

G4 TechTV is officially changing its name in January to G4.....yeah...just G4. sadness envelopes me.
