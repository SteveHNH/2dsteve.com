Ashley, my ever so awesome co-host, made the banner below this weekend! It's freakin' awesome, and we're super proud of it. One thing that you guys can do to help me out is post this thing all over the place! The code is also down below and it would make our day to see it all over the web. We'll probably make a smaller one at some point that you can drop onto the sidebar of your blog or wherever. This one is probably best to drop on your myspace or something. Do with it what you will! And subscribe to our show on iTunes, or just visit [the site](http://www.horseshoes-handgrenades.com) and download it! You won't regret it!
