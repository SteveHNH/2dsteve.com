If you haven't seen the new trailer yet, you can find a lower quality version [here](http://www.baremo.com/Star-Wars3/star-wars-episode-3-trailer.html). I've been searching all morning for a Hi-Res version. There is a torrent download of it with 2000 seeds if you want to get that. Speeds should fly with that many people seeding the trailer. It's 50 megs so it has to be great quality. Find that one[ here](http://torrentspy.com/search.asp?mode=torrentdetails&id=189210).

UPDATE: Super High Definition Version [RIGHT HERE](http://www.movie-list.net/exclusive/star-wars-ep3-trailer-hd-640.mov)! YEAH!
