I haven't posted since October!? What in the world is wrong with me!? Clearly I need to pay this blog more attention. Twitter has officially taken over my soul and m ade me feel as though I don't have to post long posts about things in my life. Well you know what? This blog is important, dagnabbit!

The big news of late: H&H Goes to Dragon*Con!

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/DragonConLogo.jpg)That's right! Ash and I are taking our little podcast that could all the way to the big ATL (Atlanta for those not in the know) and we plan on exploding that blasted city with awesome. If you're not sure what on earth I'm talking about, I'll go ahead and fill you in with all the tidbits. Dragon*Con is THE science fiction/fantasy convention, and an all around nerd fest. Even if it doesn't quite fit into the sci-fi arena, you'll still find it at Dragon*Con. It's stormtroopers, aliens, jedi, hobbits, rogues, scallywags, and ruffians of every shape and size. We're going to be among those nerds, trying to do our best to cover the mass of geekery with our microphones in hand. I have to say this is the first "Con" that I've ever been to and I think it's a good one to break myself in on. This one is close by and I'll be among friends...thousands of them!

If you want to join us at Dragon*Con, you should go buy yourself a membership at [www.dragoncon.org](http://www.dragoncon.org). Read a little about it and I'm sure you'll decide you want to go. So many celebrities will be making their way to the big city to entertain us crazy, costumed weirdos and I'm sure you'll find one you want to meet. I'm excited to have an opportunity to meet some friends and have an all around good time. I plan on sleeping VERY little while we're there, but I'm sure I'll survive.

So that's the big news from Stephen-land. I'm not going to say that I'll post here more often, because I do that all the time. I'm kind of inspired by Smashface to type in this thing because she started [writing in hers](http://phatekills.blogspot.com) again. I can't let her get that far ahead of me! Anyway, here's an open challenge to Smashy, should she read this: I bet I can write in this every day and you can't do the same! How'd you like them apples! So there it is, ladies and gentlemen. Guantlet=Thrown. Take that!

Okay, I'm done being all Braveheart now. I'll seriously give it a try. We'll see what happens!
