I have a had a blast picking up the hobby of streaming video games online.

A while back, Ashley and I decided to open up the stuff we do on the internet to more content. For me, it didn't feel right for that content to all be labeled Horseshoes & Hand Grenades. Our show has a certain brand of humor and style that didn't feel like it should encapsulate all the stuff we wanted to do. That's where 2Dorks came from. Stephanie proposed the title when Ashley and I were discussing a creative writing project. Now we have a pretty decent little following over on twitch.tv/2dorkstv where we broadcast all the fun stuff we do. Horseshoes and Hand Grenades is over there, along with anytime we want to stream a video game.

It's been pretty fun so far and we've been really happy to welcome Jacob into the fold for creating fun stuff. He and I started doing Diablo streams on Mondays and that's been super fun. Now we're talking about running dungeons in WoW as well. Stephanie actually came up with that idea when she got the itch to play it a few days ago.

I'm also officially doing The Adventures of Stephen on twitch every Tuesday night at 8:30pm. I'm going to be playing nothing but point-and-click adventure games, both old and new. I played Full Throttle already and tonight I'm starting a full franchise playthrough of the Monkey Island series. It's easily one of my favorite series' of all time. Up there with Mario for sure. I've always loved those games for the humor and really smart puzzles. I'm excited to dive back into this one because it's Â been a long time since I've played it. I have tried to fire this up once before and found that I got frustrated a littel early on, but I think I'm in the right mindset this time around.



 	  * The Secret of Monkey Island
 	  * Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge
 	  * The Curse of Monkey Island
 	  * Escape from Monkey Island
 	  * Tales of Monkey Island

I'm doing all of those above games in a row first. Then I'm going to break out into some new stuff. I just figured, why not start with one of the best adventure games of all time and then move on. After that, I might give Toonstruck a shot. I haven't played that in years and it deserves another look for sure.

Anyway, I'm excited about all this and pumped to get started. Can't wait to see where it all goes!
