I was sitting around editing together another little masterpiece to herald H&H's triumphant return, then I remembered, it's blog time! I also felt my stomach rolling over and over thanks to the fiber bar, fiber brownie, high fiber taco shells, and refried beans I had today. Why would someone eat that?! I think I was replacing other foods I typically ate with a similar equivalent, but for some reason everything had "high fiber" written on it. This is very unfortunate for me.<!-- more -->

I've also been thinking of ways to help promote our upcoming return to interwebs. I was going through a lot of the old episodes today, just listening to the old stuff to see why we had so much fun to start with. I've never laughed so hard. We had so much fun doing that show, and I can't wait to come back and keep doing it. I think it will be one of those times where you realize that you never should have quit and it picks up right where it left off. At least I hope that's how it feels. I don't think I've lost a step when it comes to talking on the internet. I was really reminded of how good our show really was when I was listening to those episodes. I've heard a lot of podcasts, and ours really kills it as far as quality goes. We may go off the rails a bit, but at least we sound awesome doing it!

I have got to get back on the bus when it comes to this whole exercise thing. I was doing really well there a while back, and I was so proud of myself. I need to find a way to capture that again, because I just haven't been able to pull myself out of this rutt I've found myself in. I tried to do P90X shoulders & arms the other day, and I nearly died. I thought I was going to vomit it hurt so bad. But that's how it's supposed to feel the first day back. I need to just make myself do it everyday. I'm not going to get any healthier by sitting around and watching TV. I'm at least eating better, but that's not everything. Steph and I want to climb one of the more challenging trails in the Smoky Mountains this year, so we have to get on the ball!

In coding news, I finished my web app today. I got a bunch of feature requests to chug through now though. I was so proud of it until I saw that it really didn't meet many of the expectations that were had :(. Eh, I guess I'll just keep chugging away until it works. It's just frustrating to work that long on something and have it not get that great of a reception. I want it to change the world, and it just didn't. Maybe my expectations were too high. I'll get back on the ball tomorrow and make something happen. I need to seriously make some progress or doing something significant. I feel like I'm in over my head sometimes. I'm sure it's just me though. I'm tough on myself...and I should quit. It's really annoying >_<
