OH WOW! I just sat through an hour of The O.C. so I could watch the Star Wars trailer and oh man was it worth it!! I was totally blown away! I have to say that I have never been this excited over a movie! It was so perfect!! Palpanine just gets crazy sinister and Anakin is following him along like a puppet. The scene that got me was when Mace Windu, accompanied by other Jedi, come into arrest Palpatine and he's like "Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?" and he totally lunges at them, lightsaber drawn. It's FREAKIN AWESOME! Okay!! I'm calm now.......WOOOOHOO! STAR WARS ROCKS!

yeah, so anyway, if you get a link to the trailer anytime soon, post it in my comments.
