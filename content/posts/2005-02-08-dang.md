Man, I just got done watching Napoleon Dynamite today and it was freakin' awesome! It reminded me of some people I knew back in the day. I loved it because it just shows that there is hope for even the nerdiest people out there. And it had the best ending of any movie I've seen man! It was perfect! It was this crazy awesome feel good movie! If you haven't seen it, then I urge you to check it out because its great!

I bought the Hawthorne Heights cd yesterday and its pretty good. I'm kind of disappointed though because I expected more out of it. After hearing "Ohio is for Lovers", I wanted it right away but I guess if I had heard more I wouldn't have wanted it as bad. It's really just more of the same I guess. It's basically Senses Fail with a different lead singer. That's what I get out of it anyway. I should have bought the Snow Patrol cd, but it was 3 bucks more so I based my decision on my wallet....bad idea.

I have post-it notes all over my desk now. I've been writing this movie like crazy and I've decided that I better write down any ideas that come to my head or I'll forget when I go to write the script. So now I have index cards and post-its everywhere. It's cool though because I feel like a writer hahah. I'm all into this now. I'm having so much fun! You guys take it easy. I'm going to sleep.
