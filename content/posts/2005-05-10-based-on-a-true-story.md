I have come to the point where I can safely admit to myself that I am a crappy review writer. So I have decided to do what comes natural and just tell you that....THE NEW [STARTING LINE](http://www.startinglinerock.com) ALBUM ROCKS! Seriously, it was definitely worth the wait! It's been forever since their last album was released, like 3 years or something...or at least it feels that way. This one has everything that I had expected and even a little more. They seem to have experimented with more sounds this time around and all their songs have different things to offer. They do have one thing in common though, and that is the super catchy sing-a-long that you just can't help but sing as you ride in the car. They've always had these infectious melodies and groovy beats that just have you either bouncing, singing, or doing both at the same time for you coordinated people. I was hoping this was going to be a good cd, and I have really not been disappointed by it. You guys should get it. It should tide you over until the new Finch album finally comes out!

Rock on!
