I think I know what Superman feels like when his powers have been sapped from being off planet too long. It's been snowing here for the past 2 weeks and hasn't really let up much at all. The sun has had about 5 minutes to poke through the never-ending overcast that continues to blanket the state, and it looks like there is no end in sight. Spring can't get here soon enough.

Today IS Valentine's Day though! It's a day to spend with your loved ones, whether that be a significant other or not, and just appreciate who each other is. I celebrated Valentine's Day yesterday with Steph up in Pittsburgh where we registered for some wedding gifts and had an awesome time at the Melting Pot stuffing our faces until they had to roll us out. It was snowy up there too, but we spent most of our time inside picking through all the kitchen stuff at Macy's and choosing our china patterns and crystal. I've never had china before so I didn't really know a whole lot about it, but Steph explained it all to me. I also got to use the little scanner thing they give you to pick out the stuff you want. Now THAT was fun. It was running Windows Mobile, which surprised me. I know, I'm a nerd.

I know this has been done before, but this time it was a band that I'm actually really into. It's amazing too! Tom Delonge and his crew have done it again. This one is called "Love" and it's clear through the album that he firmly believes that love is the answer to everything. He's right. I love that he released it on Valentine's Day too. I donated a few bucks to them because everybody who makes something this awesome deserves some compensation, and I hope that a lot of other people donated too. These guys work hard to bring us the music we want, and at least this way we know that our money is going straight to them and not into the pockets of some crooked record producer at the top of a shiny tower. He's probably petting a cat and laughing sinisterly too. Don't give your money to that.

Anyway, I'm so freaking tired right now and I can't figure out why. Maybe some Vitamin D supplements will help with my happy, but I still don't think it's a substitute for real live sunshine. That would be nice.
