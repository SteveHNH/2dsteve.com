Finally, Scott Savol has been kicked off American Idol! I was starting to worry that this kid would actually win the competition! The guy is the crappiest showman ever, and far from the best singer on the show. Apparently there is a site called [www.VoteForThe Worst.com](http://www.votefortheworst.com) that is pushing for people to vote for the worst person on the show. It's clever, but its also unfair to those people that are actually really good singers. So I'm not the biggest American Idol fan or anything, actually I rarely watch the show, but I do keep up with the goings on (thanks TiVo!) It's actually really addicting when you sit down and watch it. As long as I don't sit down I can walk away from it, but once I see a few minuts of the show I'm hooked! Anyway, we can now all breathe a sigh of relief because the Thug/Fianc√©-Beater is now finally gone!
