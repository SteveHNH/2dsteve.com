WOW, my shoulders, back, arms, and chest are absolutely killing me today! Clearly I did some work yesterday. But that's not what tonight is about. I already wrote a paragraph about that yesterday.

Stephanie has come up with an unbelievable vegetarian recipe. Now, I know what you're thinking. "But, Stephen! That's impossible! Nothing vegetarian could possibly be good!" Well, I'm here to tell you that you're wrong. I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but BEANS are vegetables! So you can fill up a delicious whole grain tortilla with beans, rice, and magical salsa and you will have a glorious dinner for yourself. Pack that sucker full of jalapenos and you've increased the awesome eminating from the burrito 10 fold. It's seriously one of my favorite meals to eat, and it's actually really good for you. This is all part of our "eat better, live better" diet that we're trying out. I don't know why I named it that. I just came up with it on the fly.<!-- more -->

I may kill our cat. She's pulling up her little rubber food mat CONSTANTLY and driving me nuts. She's behind the couch being ridiculous.

Along with making life-changing burritos this evening, Stephanie and I also sat around and worked on a budget for ourselves. We don't go overboard with spending by any means, but we definitely would like to be saving more cash and get closer to being able to buy a house. And we don't just want to buy a house, we want to be able to put down a decent down payment and actually have reasonable monthly payments on a house. That's the important thing. We figure that if we can actually forecast how much we can save every month, we'll do a better job of keeping up with it. I think we just tend to nickle-and-dime ourselves to death every month. Movie here, game purchase there, IOS apps everywhere. It's sort of like that.

I seriously can't move my arms above my shoulders. I think it's getting worse as the day goes on.

In other news! I sent some JSON from javascript over to a PHP file that queries MySQL based on the data! Well, sort of. I'm having some issues actually turning the JSON into an array that PHP can understand. Everyone with tutorials pretty much starts in the middle and assumes you know way more than you do. That's typical though.

Time to code a bit! I've told myself that I'll spend some time in codecademy every night so that I can keep up with what I'm doing. I might learn what I'm doing at some point.

By the way, The Presidents of the United States of America is a fantastic band. And when the heck did Weezer and Silversun Pickups come out with new albums?! Spotify is the best app ever.
