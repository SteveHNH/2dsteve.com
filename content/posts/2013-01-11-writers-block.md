Every night I sit down here at the desk and wonder what in the world I'm going to write about today. Every night I start typing and before I know it I have a post full of crap that means little to nothing to anyone but me. I'm totally cool with that though. The weird part is how just typing a little bit can get your brain moving. It's sort of like starting up a conversation with a friend in the car after a long silence. The worst thing you can ask in those situations is, "What do you want to talk about?" I try to avoid doing that with my blog and just start saying things that are on my mind, which, for better or for worse, winds up in a halfway lengthy blog post.<!-- more -->

I'm kind of shocked that I've been able to pull off writing in this blog for so many days in a row. I think I'm going to give the credit to my Seinfeldian Chain. It's kind of a weird name that the internet gave Jerry Seinfeld's productivity method. Lots of people feel like the Getting Things Done (GTD) model is the way to , but I just find it complicated. I feel like I spend more time organizing my GTD than I do working, which is completely against what the whole thing is about. For everyday repetitive tasks, the Seinfeldian Chain is the way to go for me. All you have to do is put an "X" on your calendar for every day you do the one thing that you need to do. For Jerry Seinfeld, that was writing one joke a day. For me, it's a blog post. One could argue that his task is far more difficult than mine.

I have been thinking a lot about writing something of more significance. Ashley and I have been playing around with an idea for a series of weird teen novels. I think we could pull it off, but neither one of us is motivated enough. I have enough time to think about it, but not really enough to sit down and write it. Okay, so I have plenty of time, but I want to use my time doing other projects. I'm trying to stay busy doing things that I can learn from. I do think I could learn from trying to write a few short stories though. I've found that writing in my blog has actually activated my brain a bit when it comes to doing creative stuff. It's been so long since I've just written something. I think the last decent bit of fiction I wrote was in High School. I should have kept it up, I just didn't have anyone pushing me. Not that I blame them. It's my responsibility to do the things I know I should be doing, with or without the push.

I do miss writing and coming up with stories though. I guess life just happens and you end up losing some of the things you loved most when you had the time. I know I did. Everything I do now is geared toward learning stuff I can use at work. I'm having fun with all of it, but I can't help but look back and think that I should have kept doing a few things. I'm going to try to get back on the bandwagon with some stuff though. My nephew started playing bass last year and he has the potential to be so good. It's kind of funny because I see myself in him in a lot of ways. I want to be there for him to tell him all the things that I wish someone had told me when I was in a band and trying to do cool stuff. There is so much to it that I wish I had known then. I guess I can do what I can to keep him on the right track...or at least go jam with him :).
