I got a new template and its all cool and stuff! It's got a bubbly feel to it, and you know how I am about bubbly interfaces! I love bubbles....ahhh....anyway! It still needs a little work, like the buttons on the sidebar, but I'm getting around to troubleshooting that issue. Feel free to view my source code and help me figure out what on earth is making the buttons space like that. It looks to me like they shouldn't, but they are. So anyway! Go to
[this site](http://blogger-templates.blogspot.com/) if you want to get some cool blogger templates. They really are neat. They also show you how to
[get rid of the blogger NavBar](http://blogger-templates.blogspot.com/2005/01/remove-navbar.html) that annoys so many of us Blogger users.

I think that's all for now! Later!
