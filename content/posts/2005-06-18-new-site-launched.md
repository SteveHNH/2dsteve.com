The new site for [Steve and Lando's On the Go Web Show](http://steveandlando.blogspot.com) has finally launched. It didn't end up being as amazingly super cool as I had originally hoped, but we had to work with the resources we were given. I'm very proud of this podcast and [Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) and I will do everything we can to make sure it stays entertaining and informative. Thanks for everyone's support and for downloading our podcast. I really never thought it would end up as good and as well recieved as it has been. Thank you guys so much. We couldn't make it without you.

So go to the new site and put it in your bookmarks. [The Feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/steveandlando) with be in the same place so there is no need to change any of your podcatching software. You will however need to go to that site from now on, becuase I'm reclaiming my blog for my own journaling as well as commentaries on stuff happening in the crazy world today.

Also, my first post is up over at [TechSpec](http://thetechspec.blogspot.com) so go check it out!
