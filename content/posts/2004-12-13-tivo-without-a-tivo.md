[Plastic Bugs](http://www.plasticbugs.com) has an awesome article today about how to use the internet to record your favorite shows ALMOST like a Tivo! Apparently some people have resorted to throwing out their cable and their Tivo because this solution is so effective! If I had fast internet I'd be all over this. All you need is [Azureus](http://azureus.sourceforge.net) (the BEST open source bittorrent client) and this plugin for it called [RSS Importer](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/plugin_details.php?plugin=RSSImport). You just set it up with the search criteria you want (i.e. SeaLab 2021) and then it will automatically download the torrent when it becomes available. Isn't that awesome!?! You guys should check out [this site for the tutorial](http://pealco.net/archives/2004/11/08/how_to_never_miss_an_episode_with_bittorrent_and_rss). The internet is a beautiful thing.
