You know, if people really acted like they do on 7th Heaven then everyone would be mad at each other all the time. I don't know why I watch this show! I somehow like it but I don't like it all at the same time. Everybody gets jealous and angry so fast, its ridiculous! I'm glad real people don't act like this, or at least the real people I know don't act like that...and I thank God everyday about that hahaha.
Anyway, enough about 7th Heaven. I rented Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 ![](http://www.gamestop.com/common/images/sbox/210611a.jpg)
today, and I have to say that it is the cooolest game! Its EXACLTY like 2004, but it's got new courses and more accessories. There are over 400 different shirts alone! Its amazing. I really do like this game though. I'm on the third day of one of the matches and I'm 41 under par. So needless to say it is fairly easy. Well so far its fairly easy. I've had a bunch of Eagles, tons of Birdies, and one Hole-In-One. You guys should check that game out. It's fun stuff.
