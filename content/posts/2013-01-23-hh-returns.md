I was going to follow up yesterday with a part 2, but I've decided that it will be neither good for me, or anyone else. It's just rant city, and I don't want to be there right now. I'm having too much fun thinking about the return of mine and Ashley's incredible PODCAST! That's right! H&H is coming back in full force. We're trimming the fat, losing the crap, and filling all that left over space with awesome! We are going to be melting some faces with hilarity the likes of which the world has never seen before!

It's been nearly six whole months since we graced the internet with our presence, and, frankly, we feel like that is simply too long! No human being should go without hearing about strange news and weird crap for six months. I don't even understand how people were able to handle it. It's a wonder every listener wasn't hunting us down and forcing our faces back on the air. We definitely had to pull ourselves up by our boot straps and make this happen again. We pulled together every resource we have to make our return, and we're excited to get underway.

H&H is a great ship with a large booty, and we want to share that with the world. I've barely survived the hiatus myself! I'm kind of like Superman, but not powered by the sun, I'm powered by my own voice travelling through the internets to other people's ears. I suppose it's a little narcissistic  but I have way too much fun with it, and Ash laughs at me a lot so it makes me feel good about myself. I'm pumped! Look out world! Here we come!
