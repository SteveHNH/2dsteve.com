Today was a good day. The new modem that we ordered from DirecWay came in today. It's all tall and has like 4 super bright LEDs on it. They're all blue and nearly blinding. It was really really easy to set up too, I was very impressed. Believe it or not, I was actually very impressed by the users manual. It was really easy to follow and had all kinds of pictures...I like pictures!

Anyway, my old modem was a USB modem that used software that ran off of the PC itself so I was forced to use Microsoft ICS to get any other computers on the network. This one, fortunately, is DHCP enabled so all I have to do is plug it in to the switch and BANG (like Emeril Lagassi) and it's all working! No real setup at all. If you can't tell, I'm in love with this modem TWiT and [Steve and Lando's On the Go Web Show](http://steveandlando.blogspot.com) are out now, so go download those. later!
