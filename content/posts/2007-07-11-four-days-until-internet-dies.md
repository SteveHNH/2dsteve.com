As of a few days ago, the FCC decided not to invoke net neutrality. This means that ISPs will now have the ability to filter content based on who pays them money. Certain websites that do not pay an added fee, will not be pushed through the internet at the same speed as other sites. Websites such as Yahoo, Google, Microsoft, and various others have enough money to pay for such a "toll", but small, independent, bloggers and podcasters like myself will have to deal with the inability to have their content delivered as it always has. I know that most people think that stuff like this never works, but it never hurts to try. Please save the internet! Check out my story and write your own at the site below.
