I just watched the season finale of season 3 of Smallville and it left so many crazy cliffhangers!! So I got all excited and looked forward to see if they would air the next episode on Monday, but to my disappointment I found that they are going right back to the first episode. Man I don't know what to do now! I figured that ABC Family wouldn't start showing episodes from season 4 because the WB isn't done with season 4 yet, I was just hoping that I was wrong. So now I have to wait until season 4 comes out on DVD or ABC Family starts airing those episodes. I'm sure it will be a while considering that the WB itself is only halfway through season 4. But I'm looking on the bright side, and that is that I get to see all the episodes at the beginning that I didn't get to see. Like the first episode that I've wanted to see for so long. YEAH MAN!I always knew that these ABC Family episodes would catch up with the WB, but I was hoping that it wouldn't be so soon. Excuse me if I sound a little obsessed but there isn't much else to think about around 7 pm on weeknights. Later!
