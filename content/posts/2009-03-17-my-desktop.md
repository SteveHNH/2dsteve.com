I just thought everybody should see this wallpaper and desktop setup because I'm very proud! I didn't make the wallpaper or anything, but I'm pretty sure it belongs on everyone's desktop. Computers can be way too distracting. The little white text stuff in the corner is my Geek Tool setup. I've got it running the 15 latest Tweets from all my Twitter friends, plus a calendar...just because. The Twitter feed updates every 5 minutes with the latest stuff and I love it. It just kind of sits itself on the desktop and you can't interact with it directly so no accidental drags or clicks or anything. It's really awesome! Click the picture for a full (and much bigger) one!
