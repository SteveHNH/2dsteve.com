yeah, I spelled it "rulez". Somebody slap me.

So I started my new job, and it is freakin' awesome! I just fix computers all day and hang out. It's so great. It's exactly what I was looking for and all the guys there are super nice. I don't know how kosher it is to talk about the workplace and what not on a Blog. People get in trouble for that stuff. I don't know, I'm not gonna mention where it is or anything. Just know that it's awesome and I'm a tech guy. I love it!

I'm thinking of starting a new podcast but I need a killer angle. I don't want it to just be another tech show, but knowing me it will involve tons of tech content. So much awesome stuff has happened in the tech world lately that I want to discuss!! I know most of you guys who visit my blog are already very tech-ish...if that's a word. Sounds more like a nationality...haha, tech-ish.....anyway!

Everybody should now immediately go to [this website](http://www.himynameismark.com) and check out "[Hi My Name Is Mark](http://www.himynameismark.com)". It's Mark Hoppus' new podcast and it's great! I've listened to the two episodes that are out and both are super entertaining. It's basically Mark doing interviews with people in different bands and introducing all of us to some sweet music. There was this one band on episode 2 called "Zolof the Rock and Roll Destroyer"..or something along those lines. They were awesome! Just download the podcast to here them.

So that's all I really have to say. I'm making money now so I'm considering moving my current blog somewhere else. Unfortunatly both Ninjatech.com and TechJunky.com were taken....FOOLS! So I have to come up with a name, aquire a server, and a content management system like [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/), or [Drupal](http://drupal.org/), or [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/)...not really sure yet. So that's my current project. I'm always up to something and as long as I live, a blog there shall be!! Later guys. Take it easy.

On a side note, those little MOLESKIN notebooks you see in the bookstore are actually pronounced "Mole-eh-skee-nay". It's Italian
