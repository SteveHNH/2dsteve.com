I figured out how to change the size of my blog...well the width..or something like that. I like all this template hacking and customizing and stuff. If I can't find a pre-designed template that looks awesome, I'll just hack this one until I get it the way I want it. The comments thing from [Haloscan](http://www.haloscan.com) is awesome, but I wanted my posts to take up more space side to side therefore requiring less scrolling. So I changed it. Plus, I figure that most people use 1024 x 768 screen resolution so it's not going to look to crazy to most people. So there it is, changed a little bit.
Man I have enjoyed sleeping in this weekend, but I think I've slept so much that I feel like I haven't slept at all. You know that feeling? But today was productive! Unlike yesterday which consisted of me playing Tiger Woods golf. Yep...I'm still stuck on it. We built some stalls for the horses today and they look pretty good. I managed to bang my fingers with the hammer enough though, one of them turned purple....and that is not fun. But at least I did something.
You know I've been taking these Centrum vitamins because I think I have a vitamin B deficiency. I never have energy and they say that vitamin B is the cause of that. So yeah, I've been taking these vitamins but sadly they have fixed my energy, but caused me bowel problems.....yep. So now I've been off of them for a few days and everythings working right again but I'm tired. I think I'm gonna need to find some vitamins that just fix your vitamin B.
Anyway, Linux class starts tomorrow and I'm crazy excited! This is the one I've been waiting for. Sorry about this long post, just had a lot to say today. Later!
