](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/logo_t.gif)I've pretty much spent this entire day poking around on the internet trying to get into whatever it is one can get into on the internet. Minus the porn, though. I don't really need to get into any of that. I've really just been trying to find some nifty software or websites that can do some stuff I want to do. One of the things that I have really been hunting down for the past few months is a decent comic collecting application for the Mac. I have C[omic Collector Live](http://www.comiccollectorlive.com) for the PC and I absolutely LOVE it. The only problem with it is that it's on Windows! Since I don't use Windows as a primary machine, it's kind of annoying to have to switch over to Parallels or Boot Camp in order to add comics to my database. It's not that big of a deal, but why isn't there software like this for Mac? It seems like something that would be very Mac-centric, but nobody makes anything good enough. If any of you know of something, please tell me in the comments.

It's a different kind of service that I'm trying to find a use for. Think of it as Twitter for your purchases or the items you get from services like [Audible](http://www.audible.com) or [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com). I think it's kind of neat and I, of course, have a Blippy Â page that you can visit and check out what I've been getting, though it's pretty short. The one piece I haven't jumped on is the credit card purchases tool. I'm currently showing my purchases from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), [Audible](http://www.audible.com), and [iTunes](http://www.itunes.com). I think the credit card piece could be pretty awesome, but I think one would definitely want a "special" credit card that you wanted [Blippy](http://www.blippy.com) to track. That way you could hide Christmas presents or birthday presents by using a different card. I'm still trying to figure out what purpose this will serve in my all around social networking world, but I think it has some possibilities. If you are on [Blippy](http://www.blippy.com), follow me on [my page](http://blippy.com/stevehnh)!

I've also hooked up Ashley, of "The Penguin Legion", with a URL that points straight to her blog of, you guessed it, [www.thepenguinlegion.com](http://www.thepenguinlegion.com). I don't think she knows yet, but she will once she reads this post. So add her blog to your list of favorites and visit often. She's brilliant.

I'm pretty sure that's all I've really messed with today. That's not to say it wasn't time consuming. Searching for good software can be such a pain, especially when you have to test each one to see if it meets your needs. I think I'm going to go find some food now. Hopefully I don't have to look much beyond the kitchen because there is about 2 feet of snow outside that I would rather not venture out into.
