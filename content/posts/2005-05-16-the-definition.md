According to the New Oxford American Dictionary 2nd Edition, this is the definition of a Blog.

blog
noun
a weblog: blogs run by twenty-something Americans with at least an unhealthy interest in computers.

Now this could be a very accurate definition if they are talking about me, but I am not the only blogger in the world. A lot of bloggers might very well not care much at all for computers and just want to talk about stuff.

This is a really fun definition though, and one I had no clue was actually in the Oxford American Dictionary. Thanks [Plastic Bugs](http://www.plasticbugs.com/) for showing us all what Oxford thinks of us.
