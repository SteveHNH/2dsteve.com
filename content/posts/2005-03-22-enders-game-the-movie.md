Oh yes! You have read right! They have finally started writing the script for the film adaptation of this amazing science fiction novel by Orson Scott Card. Not many books capture me and pull me in like Ender's Game did when I read it. It seriously is one of those books that you just can't put down. It's about this war that has been raging between Earth and The Buggers for a hundred years. The government starts developing these super soldiers by taking them as kids to camps where they can train. The story follows 6 year old Ender Wiggin as he tries to cope with leaving his family, dealing with mean kids, and most of all saving the world.

It really is one of the most intense books I have ever read and I'm really excited that it is finally getting made into a movie. My only concern is that they are getting the same people who wrote Troy *shudder* to write the script. I can only pray that they don't make another awful movie like that one. As long as Brad Pitt doesn't play Ender, it could be good!
