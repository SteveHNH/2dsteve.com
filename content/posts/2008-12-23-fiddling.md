So I just spent the last hour and a half trying to find a new theme to spruce up my blog and ended up realizing that the one I have is just fine. There are SO many wordpress themes out there that look cool, but none of them really meet my needs. I just need a simple theme for a blog that is easy to edit so I can make it more unique to me. I played with one for a while that I thought would be awesome, but it just ended up not working out. i think I just need to put more pictures in my posts to make my blog look snazzier.
