I was really hoping to get my [Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/) keyboard today. UPS told me it would be here, only to let me down as the day dragged on.

I shouldn't be bothered by it, but it was sad. Not only that, I have no idea when it's supposed to get here because the tracking hasn't updated in four days.

Remember how I talked about doing more short posts? Yeah, aren't you glad I decided to do that? \o/
