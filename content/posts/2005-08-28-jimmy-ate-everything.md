Oh wow!

That's all I really have to say about the Jimmy Eat World show last night. Man there were so many people there. I figure there were probably at least 3000 people. It didn't surprise me considering the concert was free! Even the water there was free!

Anyway, JEW played one amazing show. They played so many awesome songs, and a couple I hadn't heard before, or at least didn't know the words to. I remember them playing The Middle, Bleed American, Pain, 23, Goodbye Sky Harbor, Seventeen, Sweetness, Work, Kill, and tons of others. Man they were so awesome. They played so many rockin' songs and then a bunch of slower ones and it was just a perfect blend of rock and melody. I love that band.

Underoath also played and they weren't that bad, I'm just not into hardcore so much. They sounded better on their pure volume page than live. They did make it a point to let everybody they did what they did "all to the glory of Jesus Chist." I thought that was so awesome of them. And a ton of people cheered and I was pleasantly surprised.

I have to be in a band now. Patti we need to jam man. Seeing bands live makes me miss that so much, and I didn't even have that many shows. It was just the thrill of being on stage and seeing all kinds of people rocking out to YOUR music.

Well I'm gonna go eat a sammich, later!
