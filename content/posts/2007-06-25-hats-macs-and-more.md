I know, I know, I've failed miserably at keeping this blog up to date and actually writing what's going on in my life and news. Well, Stephanie's been here for a while and I like to try to spend as much time with her as I can because I never know when I'll get to see her when she leaves. Yeah, I know it's all emo-tastic and silly to all you people. But you try spending countless weeks away from your fiance and then you can come back and talk to me :).

Anyway, some awesome events happened. I'll start from a long time ago and work my way forward, that way all this makes sense.

Well, I can't remember if I told you guys or not, but a while back I purchased a hat from a guy named Steve Delk at [www.adventurebilt.com](http://www.adventurebilt.com). Well, this guy makes the most accurate Indiana Jones fedora that [![ab.jpg](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/ab.jpg)

Needless to say its a super high quality fedora and I bought one. Well, some time passed and it turns out that Mr. Delk will be making all the fedoras for Indiana Jones IV! Turns out that I'm going to be getting a fedora made by the same guy that's making the hats for the fourth movie! I'm too excited! From what Steve told me, I should be getting the hat sometime at the end of July or beginning of August. I've been waiting since February so I'll be ecstatic when it finally gets here! So, if you want a hat, buy one now. His prices are going up in July from $250 to $450. At least for a time so he can slow down his orders and not have people waiting for years.

Well, that news being told, I've got something else that I can tell you guys about. I'm now the proud owner of a black Apple MacBook! It's taken me forever to finally get one, but I now have a brand spankin' new mac to do all of my multimedia crap on. I've been using it nonstop and it's definitely an improvement[![macbook.jpg](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/macbook.thumbnail.jpg)
](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/macbook.jpg) from my old Powerbook G4. I love that old thing, but it just was slow as Christmas and wasn't Intel based so I couldn't take advantage of any of the new "Intel-only" stuff. I'm loving it so far, and have decided that it's going to be my podcasting and blogging machine. I'm going to be doing all the pi and chips stuff on it, and storing all my blog backups and what-not. So, I'm pretty much turning my Windows PC into a gaming rig, and a place to put other knick-knacks that I can't get on OS X. But there's not much I can't do with this baby. At least I can sit on my couch and use my laptop, wire free. My old laptop would've been great if the battery lasted more than 10 minutes and it had more processing power. Anyway, I'm really happy.

Well, that's about it. I hate to make super long posts, but I had a lot to say and it's been a while. I'll try to get better at posting, but my life isn't all that interesting most of the time. I go to work, come home, and play on internet for a while. Anyway, you guys take it easy. Have a good one!
