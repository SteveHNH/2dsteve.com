I never played **Dark Souls 3**. I'm almost ashamed to say that I've never played a **Dark Souls** game at all. The idea of dying over and over continuously just turns me off. Not only that, but I can't really get into the aesthetic of the game. It's so dark, moody, and, well, ugly to look at. I realize that it has some beautiful graphics in a lot of ways, but there is something wrong with the way the character moves around the screen, or the way things flow with each other. It just doesn't work for me.

Now, all that being said, I am fascinated by the game. I watch from a distance, and I can't help but want to attempt it. This game is nearly a 10/10 on most scales, and I am avoiding it. I don't know why I haven't picked it up to at least try it. It makes sense that once I start poking around in it, I would likely start to understand the look and get absorbed into the world. I'm certain that this would happen. There is **ONE** thing that makes me want to play this game above all else.

**THE RHYTHM**

My buddy, Chris, introduced me to the following video regarding the secret rhythm of **Dark Souls**. It's an attempt at decyphering why one boss in particular in the game is more difficult than most others. The idea is that each boss has a rhythm that seems to go with the music attributed to them. There is a wind up, and a punch with most boss attacks, and these follow certain rules. One boss, The Dancer of the Boreal Valley, doesn't follow the same rules as other bosses. Her theme is in a completely different timing than the other ones.

Anyway, I say all this really just to say that I need to give the game a try. One of these days I'll pick it up and go through the pain of constant death like all the other cool kids. In the meantime, don't take my word for it, just watch this incredibly well done video.
