I find myself in a very inconvenient spot right now, and that is a spot without any internet whatsoever. I never really realize how much I lean on the internet until I don't have it at all. To make matters worse, the TV is also not working at the moment. It is doing nothing to help me cope with the situation other than the peaceful fuzz that actually is can work pretty good as a sleep aid. At least for me, but I'm weird like that. Just in case you are wondering how on earth I am writing a blog post, the computer still works and I'm using it to document my internet-less moment.

It's been down for a while now and I was sitting around trying to find something else to do but I just can't seem to find anything. It's not there aren't things to do, I just don't feel like doing any of the things that I could be doing. I really need to clean up my desk, or clean my bathroom, or clean ... well, everything in general. I did manage to go get the mail and enjoy a few minutes of sunshine. Man, I just can't get enough of that stuff.

The mailbox was especially kind today and greeted me with a few Netflix movies, one of them being Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds live! I'm actually watching it right now and it's freakin' awesome! The guy is a magician on the guitar. I wish I could learn to play as good as he can, but I just think some people are born with more talent than others. I really wish that I could sing...at all. It's fun playing guitar, but some things just can't be expressed with only musical notes. I feel like 10 people reading this just went, "Whoa! Yes they can!" Well, maybe your right, but you can't really get specific without some good words to accentuate the feeling of your music.

Speaking of music, I started playing guitar since the internet went down and am really enjoying myself. I've been trying to master two songs right now and am getting somewhere. I've got them down on guitar but I'm entertaining myself by trying to sing them decently too so I can enjoy playing them when I'm alone. In case you are curious, the songs are "Walk Through Hell" by Say Anything, and "The Freshmen" by The Verve Pipe. I know that "The Freshmen" is an old song, but some songs are just classic and deserve to be learned. It's got a really sweet little acoustic riff in it and I love it.

I guess I'll let you guys go now and I'll continue to enjoy my Dave Matthews DVD. Not that I was holding you here or anything, because I'm pretty sure I can't do that. Unless, of course, I've captivated you so much with my brilliant words that you can't seem to pull yourself away from the computer screen. In that case, I release you! Later!
