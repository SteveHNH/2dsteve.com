Hey Everybody! Look at this! I've actually posted more than 1 time in a week. I must be butter, 'cause I'm on a roll....yeah that was bad. Anyway, onto the point of this whole post.

I received an invite to [Kevin Rose](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_rose)'s new social networking service called "[Pownce](http://www.pownce.com)." I'm really digging it so far because it's like [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) but has a few more things you can do. It has a basic, simple interface that we know all of us web 2.0 geeks are really into. It allows you to send messages, links, files, and event notices to a group of people in a really quick way. One of the big advantages over [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) that [Pownce](http://www.pownce.com) has, aside from the fact that [Kevin Rose](http://http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_rose) is an icon in the social networking world with a flock of sheep (including me) that follow him around everywhere, is that you can designate who you want to receive a message from you through groups. I can put all my close friends into a group and designate to only send the above mentioned things to those people. Twitter always sends every message you post to everybody.

There is also a desktop app that you can download that communicates to Pownce and updates every 60 seconds with new messages and other posts. I like it too but it's a little wonky and doesn't allow you to reply straight from the application. It seems like a quick way to post something, but the web is a little more reliable.

Of course the best way to work with something like this is to have a ton of friends using. Unfortunately, only a handful of my friends will actually use a tool like this, much less use it for long periods of time. Anyway, you guys should try it out. Sign up to get an invitation to the beta. I'm trying to save the ones I have for a little contest that [Horseshoes & Hand Grenades](http://www.horseshoes-handgrenades.com) will be doing. Look forward to that coming at you on Episode 14. Either way, you should read about it and see what it can do. It needs a handful more features and then I'll be completely sold on it.
