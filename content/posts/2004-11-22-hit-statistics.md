Well, I took the time yesterday to actually look at the statistics for my hits that[ SiteMeter](http://www.sitemeter.com) emails me and sadly most people only stay for their allotted 30 seconds and then move on. I don't know whether I am just not that interesting or people just want traffic for themselves. But thats okay because I love this little blog. And blogging isn't all about traffic like some people seem to believe, I love typing this stuff because:
1. It gives me some place to express myself
2. My friends read it.
I also love [blog explosion](http://www.blogexplosion.com) because you find some truly awesome stuff, so more people should browse it and actually read what they come across rather than just browse to gain credits and attention for themselves.
Well thats my soapbox I suppose. I'm gonna go to my incredibly boring Biology class now and space out for a while. You guys take it easy!
