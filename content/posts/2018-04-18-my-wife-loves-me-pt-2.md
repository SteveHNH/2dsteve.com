Last week, I wrote a post about how my wife loves me by hating me just enough to get me into the gym. This week, I'm here to talk about an entirely different kind of love. The kind of love that lets you live out your dreams without making you do things that are good for you. The kind of love that says, "You're a complete nerd and you have habits that may kill you one day, but I'm going to let you indulge in this one because it means so much to you."

That kind of love, ladies and gentlemen, buys you tickets to see The Avengers: Infinity War at the **Alamo Drafthouse!**

Yep! The Alamo Drafthouse here in Raleigh opened on April 12, just in time for one of the biggest releases of the year and the kickoff of the Summer movie season. I'm so unbelievably excited about this. The stars aligned and not only did Marvel decide to shift The Avengers release to my birthday weekend, but the Alamo Drafthouse is here for me to watch it in all it's glory. It's prove that God loves me and wants me to be happy.

I've wanted to go to an Alamo Drafthouse to see a movie since I lived in Tallahassee way back in '08. I think that was around the time where I discovered that they existed and had some pretty intense rules for movie viewing in their establishment. They're a place that you go if you're a movie fan that really doesn't have any patience for people who aren't really there for the movie, or love to pull their phones out while you're trying to enjoy your film. I was really keen on it a few years back because I think Tallahassee audiences were some of the worst I had ever been around. The Raleigh area hasn't really messed me up too much when we go to see movies. I think I've had to tell a couple people to be quiet over the few years that we've been here. That being said, a set of rules that means you can get pulled out of the theatre for being obnoxious is pretty awesome.

They have a ton of food and drinks as well, so I'm excited to see how all of that works. I'm just so pumped I'm gonna die. I can't believe Stephanie thought to do this for me on my birthday. The Avengers on my birthday at Alamo Drafthouse. Good gravy.
