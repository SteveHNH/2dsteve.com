Hey everybody!

![](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/images/DSC00859.JPG)
I know it's been a long time since I've written anything in this blog, but hey, things happen. Anyway, I have done a bunch over the last week that I haven't written about. The most important thing being that I bought a car!! I'm so excited over it and it drives so awesome! It's a Scion tC! It's really nice and it drives smooth and fast. It's got an iPod connector in it so I don't have to worry about cassette tape adapters like in my old Jeep. It's got a CD/MP3/WMA player in it so I can just throw a bunch of mp3's on a cd and listen to them. It's so awesome. I can't really describe how cool it is because most of it you have to see. It really is cool.

Anyway, I've done that and I'm also heading up to West Virginia on Tuesday. I managed to get Wednesday off from work so I could have an extra day to drive. It's going to be a great trip. We're going to play DnD and Baldur's Gate and have Thanksgiving dinner. I'm tooo excited. Plus I get to see Stephanie which is always awesome. It's been about 4 months and that's just way too long. But I'm dealing with it the best way I know how, and that is staying busy.

I've been working on my site off and on, and things are coming along nicely. I'm just slowing down a bit, but I know I'll hit one of those spots where I get crazy into it again. We'll just see I guess. I'll let you know when it's up and running.

Another thing! I went and did the unthinkable...I set up a myspace account. Yeah I know, it's sad. But all my friends have myspace accounts and nobody visits my blog, so I needed a way to be heard. I checked my site stats and it said I've had 1 hit in a week.....but now that I think about it...I could be wrong because I don't remember re-copying my hit counter on to this new template...oh wow! Now I don't feel as bad. But anyway, I do have a myspace and if you care to see it you can find it here: http://www.myspace.com/fulltangninja

Anyway, that's about it for me for now. You guys take it easy. If I don't post before Thanksgiving, then have a good one! later!
