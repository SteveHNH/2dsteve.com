I found this today as I was browsing the internet and I thought I would share it with my.....4 readers haha. I guess Micro$oft has decided to enter the blogging business and start what they call "M$N SPACES". Well, apparently, M$N SPACES sucks like crazy because they apply a "dirty word" filter, and some of those "dirty words" are not dirty words at all. I found this page that talks about how far M$ will go to limit your right to free speech. [Check it out](http://www.boingboing.net/2004/12/02/msn_spaces_seven_dir.html)!
CAUTION: SOME PROFANITY
