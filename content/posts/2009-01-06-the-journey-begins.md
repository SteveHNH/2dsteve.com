The above video was filmed with my sweet little Flip MinoHD, so please forgive some of the shakiness. I tried to pull as much entertaining crap out of our trip as I could, but it turns out that most of the awesome stuff wasn't on camera! Blast! This is why I need a dude following me around with a camera and documenting my every move. That word work :). Enjoy!
