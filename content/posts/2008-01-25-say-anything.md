My good buddy Patrick has introduce me to what has become one of my favorite bands ever: Say Anything. These guys are incredible. It did take me a bit to get into them because they are all over the place in terms of musical style, but that really adds to their appeal. I've found a few videos on YouTube of their lead singer, Max Bemis, playing a few of their songs. I guess it's from something he did with MTV at some point. These are acoustic, but the real version are freakin' rockin' huge :). So check this one out as a sample, because I love it. I hope you will too :)
