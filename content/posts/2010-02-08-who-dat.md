](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/superbowl_xliv1-e1265600737974.jpg)Today was Super Bowl XLIV. That's Super Bowl 44 for those not so "up" on the old school Roman numerals. I'm going to be honest and say that I had no idea who was going to win this one going in. I've never been a fan of the Colts or the Saints, so I just rooted for the team I thought wanted it the most. Which is kind of silly, because you know that if they are at the Super Bowl to begin with then they want it pretty bad. I decided that the Saints were going to win this a few days ago, and I really have no basis for why I thought they were. They have a lot of heart I guess

Steph and I were going to go over to a party tonight to watch it, but the snow totally ruined those plans. Didn't bother us all that much though because we still had some killer spinach dip, a comfy couch, and an HDTV. I don't know about you guys, but I'm pretty sure that's all you really need to have an awesome night watching some football.

This snow looks like it's going to mess up more than a Super Bowl party night though. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it to work tomorrow or not. I think I'm going to have to pass. From looking at the way these cars are moving out there, it would not be wise for me to get out on the road in the morning. It's not like the ice is going to melt in this 15 degree weather. I'll just have to make up the time later in the week. Steph doesn't have school tomorrow, so that is half the reason that I'm thinking I'm going to have to stay out as well. WVU never cancels classes, so clearly they think it's too dangerous for the students to get out on the road. Which means that it's probably too dangerous for normal humans too

We'll see what happens! Until next time, mortals!
