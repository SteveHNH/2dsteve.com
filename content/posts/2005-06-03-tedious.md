I am loving this editing process for our movie! I have never used any video editing software as simple to use as Final Cut Pro for Mac. I was going into this project thinking that I was way over my head and I'd never figure out how to work this software but so far I have been pleasantly surprised. It didn't take much time at all to catch on to how it all works and I've already got the majority of our footage on my computer.

The whole importing process is much easier than using iMovie. You can actually go through all the footage on your camera and mark the spots you want to import and then tell Final Cut Pro to import them all at once! You don't have to sit there and import each clip individually. Its so amazing!

Even getting all my sound right is easy! I'm seriously in love with this program right now and it has made me feel much more positive about making movies in general. I really want to make more at some point but I'll probably wait until I move. Trying to shoot a movie in 2 weeks was dumb. The movie does have a few plot holes that I didn't discover until after I started editing, and now there is no way to reshoot since my friends are gone. But what is a movie without a few good plot holes right!?

Okay, so I should have the movie done after this weekend and then I'll see if I can get it on the internet for everyone to download. Later!!
