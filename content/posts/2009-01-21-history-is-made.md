](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/barack-obama-capitol.jpg)Today is a fantastic day in the history of our country. Love him or hate him, Barack Obama is the new president of the United States of America. I am so very proud to be a part of this moment in time. I know I'm not exactly from the side of the fence that has suffered through civil rights issues, bigotry, and had to fight twice as hard to climb the ladder of success, but I recognize it and acknowledge that today is a very proud day in history for African-Americans. It is for me too! I'm so thrilled about the ideas that Barack Obama brings to office and all my prayers and hopes go out to him and his cabinet. It's so difficult for one man to make any major changes in anything, but I believe that he can do it if he holds the pure ambitions and desires that have got him this far. I can only hope that capitol hill doesn't corrupt his ideals.

I am a very posotive person in general. I tend to look at the bright side of every situation and do my best to give someone the benefit of the doubt. This has worked for me so far, but it does occasionally cause me to either look like a doofus or do something completely ridiculous. I know a lot of people are cynical about President Obama's (it's so cool to say that) plans, but I feel like sometimes all it takes is someone who gets a dream and doesn't let go. Take Martin Luther King Jr. for example. The guy basically came out with ideas that were unheard of at the time, but was able to plant the seeds of what we saw today. This milestone has happened years after his death, but we still recognized that he started this snowball rolling. I hope that Obama can get some snowballs of his own rolling down that hill and growing into something amazing.

I can only ask the cynics to give the man a chance. Don't shut out hope so easily. Be a seven year old for a few minutes and believe that people can make changes even when all the odds are against them. It's not wrong to dream big, it's not wrong to hope, and it's definitely not wrong to believe in someone else that can dream those big dreams and hope for a better world. Let's just stand together now and see what happens over the course of the next four years. Regardless of what happens, I'll always know how this four years began: with the dreams of millions of people being fulfilled.
