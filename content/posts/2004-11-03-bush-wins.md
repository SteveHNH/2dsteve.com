Yeah Buddy! I just read on Yahoo! News that Kerry called to concede the presidency to Bush. Heck yeah! I'm glad because I voted for Bush. Good ol' George W. Yep, anyway. I just wanted to express my excitement about this! WOOOHOOO! I was scared for a little while but it all turned out alright. Another 4 years of good strong leadership. Good deal!
