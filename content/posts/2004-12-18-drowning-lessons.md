Well I am finally off for Christmas break now! WOO! I could not be happier right now. I just needed a good long break. It's not like my classes are too hard or anything but it just gets so monotonous. I think I did good in all my classes. Maybe I didn't get an A in Biology but who DOES get an A in biology, Honestly.

I'm in a mood where I just want to be in a band. I've been listening to all kinds of good music and it makes me want to be in a band so bad. It's ridiculous. I could sit here and play guitar all day and never come up with something as cool as me, [Patti](http://pattiwack.blogpspot.com), and Jason used to come up with. I just can't work by myself. I do have those rare times when I just happen to stumble across something really cool but I can't ever remember it and it usually doesn't sound good a few days later. I don't know what happens but it just doesn't work out. Someone play guitar with me.

I got My Chemical Romance's old cd and its pretty good. I think their new one is better, which is rare for most bands, but it just seems cleaner. Now don't get me wrong, I love most band's first cd's better than their newer ones, but these guys just seemed to get better with age. It's really not that bad though. There is a riff in this song called "Drowning Lessons" that just caught me by surprise and had me hooked. Its awesome. You guys should listen to [Hawthorne Heights](http://www.purevolume.com/hawthorneheights) too. They are really really good.

Anyway, You guys take it easy. Enjoy your Christmas, Hannakuh (I totally forgot how to spell it just now), and Kwanzaa.  My posts might be a little farther apart for the next couple weeks, I'm dealing with ridiculously slow internet and I have no school internet to take advantage of. But you guys stay cool!
