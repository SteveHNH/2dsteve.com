Geez today was interesting. I left school and it was raining but it didn't seem too bad. Then I called my mom to let her know I was on my way home and she told me a tree had fallen on our shed and just destroyed it. The whole back of the shed just got smashed. Our pool shed had the whole side of it just folded over like it was nothing. I guess the winds got really rough out here and we don't know if it was a tornado or just really high winds. Either way, we weren't expecting anything like this. So we have a lot of repairing to do but I'm glad our house didn't get hit by it. There was absolutely no damage to the house! So I'm really glad about that, but the shed is really screwed up. Anyway, I just thought you guys should know about all this. Tornadoes Suck!
