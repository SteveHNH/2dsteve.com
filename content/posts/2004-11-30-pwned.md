I found this in the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn) , mostly because I was confirming what I thought this was (yes, you can laugh now [Lando](http://www.landoman.info)), and I figured it would be fun to post. If you are every confused about leet-speak, the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwn) is where you go man, its awesome! So here is the history of PWNED.



The most widely held theory is that "pwn" originated from a typo in first-person shooter games, the common mistake occurred from a hand position. The user, using his mouse right-handedly, would hold three of his fingers on the keys, "a," "w," and "d," along with the mouse in his right hand. When prompted to make a comment upon [fragging](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frag) his opponent, a quick motion to type the word "own" resulted in a typo. Due to the proximity of the keys on a standard [QWERTY keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) the user hit the "p" instead of the "o" key, resulting in the word "pwn."

 

Some people believe that the word was originally a [contraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraction) of the term "power-owned," "pure [ownage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ownage)," "[pistol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol)-owned", or "properly owned." These are probably [backronyms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym).

 

It has been suggested that the word resulted from a [rendering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering) problem from a specific game that made the word "owned" look like the word "pwned." As a result, gamers considering themselves superior in skill started using the word as an obscure reference.

 

Finally, one other story reports that in the game [Starcraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starcraft), someone set the option so that losing players would see a special message. However, instead of typing in "YOU WERE OWNED," a typo resulted in "YOU WERE PWNED." It is said that every use of the word "pwn" therefore comes from this one hapless misspelling, or a similar one occurring in a [Warcraft](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft) or [Unreal Tournament](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament) game.
