This is the beginning of a new era! I shall post a comic every few days about friends. This one is about Patti. I love Patti but we used to draw these comics of each other and it usually ended disastrously but it got us all laughing like mad. Its awesome. It's because I love patti that I drew the first one about him. You da man patrick! [![Posted by Hello](http://photos1.blogger.com/pbh.gif)
