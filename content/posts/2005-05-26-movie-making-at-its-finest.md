Well we have now completed most of the more difficult scenes for our movie, The Shed. It's actually coming along pretty well but I guess I won't really know how well it's going until we actually have some scenes editing and some music. This is definitely a low budget film so don't expect anything extreme. But this movie is going to be awesome!!

We haven't had much trouble getting the scenes on tape, but there have been a few setbacks. We were going to use a dirt road for a few scenes but, unfortunately, that dirt road has already been claimed by a hive of wasps and other various stinging insects. So we are on the search for a new road. From this point on shooting should be a breeze. I'm not at all worried about doing any scenes that involve the shed itself or anything around it. Our RAM should come in today and then I can get around to editing it.

I have no idea how big this file is going to be until I encode it. It might be well above 200 to 300MB to download. I'm going to host it at this free webserver I've discovered as well, so I have no idea how that will go. But we're going to give it a try. The file will be encoded with [DivX](http://www.divx.com) so you'll need to have the DivX codec installed. Or you can just go get the spyware-less open source version, [Xvid](http://www.xvid.org/). I recommend Xvid because it plays DivX video and you don't have to worry about any bundled software.

Anyway, that's about it for now. I'm going to start memorizing my lines now so everything can go a bit smoother and then we should rap this up tonight. If not tonight, it will be done tomorrow and then the real work can begin.
