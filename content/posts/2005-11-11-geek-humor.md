When I installed Mambo on my server today I went to view the default page and this was there:



<blockquote>Yesterday all servers in the U.S. went out on strike in a bid to get more RAM and better CPUs. A spokes person said that the need for better RAM was due to some fool increasing the front-side bus speed. In future, busses will be told to slow down in residential motherboards.</blockquote>

HA! I laughed! Just a bit of geeky humor for you guys while I'm hard at work on something that will blow your minds.
