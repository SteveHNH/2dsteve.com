Hey Everybody! If you want to see something really cool, download this video! It's a movie that me and my friends made. Its totally awesome, or at least I think so. You might like it. Just download it, its only 3 megs so the quality is slightly low, but its still awesome. Its in Windows Media format so you should all be able to watch it. DOWNLOAD!

well apparently tripod is stupid and I can't link directly to the file so go [here](http://chiwawafilms.tripod.com) and download Wang Chung Tonight. Right-click it and "save file to disk" (or whatever it says) so I can save some bandwidth. This movie is like 3 years old, but its still kickin'!!
