Man is my internet slow. It took me a good 5 minutes to get from the[ blogger.com](http://www.blogger.com) hompage to this posting board. That's really really sad. Today was good man, I actually did something in my A+ class.....review questions! Hey its not much, but its something! After that me and Karl took to the NES roms and played some Bubble Bobble. That's a pretty killer game. You guys should check that out man. If you want to get some roms and stuff type this in [Google](http://www.google.com)- “parent directory ” /nes/roms -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums  . I really recommend finding a copy of VirtuaNES because its totally simple and straightforward to use. For those of you who DON'T know what I'm talking about. I'm talking about Emulating an NES on your computer. That way you can play all your old school Nintendo games. Its great, especially when you're bored. For those of you who get really into it, you can get this sweet Nintendo control from [this guy](http://www.sealiecomputing.com/retrozone/retropad.html) that plugs into your USB port.
I also made another discovery today! This site called [Bitoogle!](http://www.bitoogle.com) You can actually search out .torrent files instead of wandering aimlessly around cyberspace trying to find what you are looking for. Its really an awesome search engine. I guess thats all I really have to say today. I'm well on my way to beating Ninja Gaiden. I'm on chapter 10, and I think there are 16 chapters....okay so I still have a ways to go, but I feel like I'm getting closer, which is important. Have I mentioned how much I love my modded Xbox hahaha. Trainers are beautiful. Later![](http://www.bitoogle.com)
