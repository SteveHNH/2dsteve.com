Hey hey hey! I just got back from taking the trash to the dump and on my way back I had the priveledge of hearing this country song "Whiskey for my men, Beer for my horses" haha! Man that's a cool song. Yes its true, I LIKE country. I guess it comes from just growing up around it in Alabama and Georgia. Its not everyday you find a guy who likes punk rock, emo, AND country. Okay, so its not my favorite music but I do have to listen to it every now and then or I have withdrawals. It takes me back to the good ol' days.
I'm really getting used to Linux now and I almost prefer it to Windows. I guess it's mostly because I feel smart when I use it and it is a danger to Micro$oft. I really don't like corporate giants. I've learned that almost anything you can do with Windows, you can do with Linux. The only drawback to using Linux is that there aren't many big games for it. Its sad because it's such a cool  Operating System.
I take my second A+ exam tomorrow and I'm totally gonna pass it. I'm so confident in this one it's ridiculous! I shall be A+ Certified as of 1:30 tomorrow afternoon. I'm thinking that next month I'll take my Linux+ exam because I love this stuff and I'm learning it really well. It just sticks with me. I am one of those rare people that actually likes command line and scripting and programming. Well thats enough for the geeky conversation today.
By the way, check out [Life in the Shadows](http://arthurlifeintheshadows.blogspot.com) today because he has a great post on Ebaum's World. I spent a good 3 hours there today playing games and stuff. I'm officially addicted now. Thanks Arthur hahah. Later!
