Well I've been trying all day to get my new [Google ](http://www.google.com)search bar to work with this site but it just ain't happenin'. Apparently [Google ](http://www.google.com)hasn't indexed my site so there is no way for the search to find what I'm looking for within this webpage. You would think that since [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) is owned by [Google](http://www.google.com), that this would be a simple process, but it isn't. I put in for my site to be indexed so it can be searchable but this could take a while. If it doesn't work within the next week, I'm going to remove the search bar. I only added it because this blog is getting really big and I needed some way of finding old posts.

Also, my[ online status indicators](http://www.onlinestatus.org) have been having some trouble lately and I'm trying to get that resolved. I'm thinking that the host for those thing is having a lot of problems. I finally got my MSN indicator to show something other than a "?", but when I tried to move my other ones to the server that that one is on it just showed "?" for all of them! I just can't win! So, until I figure all that out, expect some weird happenings in my sidebar. I don't know how many of you even noticed that I had [online status indicators](http://www.onlinestatus.org), but I do. So feel free to send me a message sometime.

In other news, I'm writing a short film for when a few of my friends come down next week. I've been wanting to make a movie for a while and I think I've finally found something I really want to do. It's just gonna be a short horror film because those are really easy to do if you have no money. I want it to be really good though so I'm actually writing this all out. My last attempt at a horror movie ended horrendously with a Mortal Kombat fight scene that went entirely too long. So I'm trying to avoid those mistakes this time around. I'm going for more of an "atmosphere" of scariness than a slasher/killer/zombie/mutant movie. So maybe it will work out and it will be awesome. We've got two weeks together so we'll have plenty of time to shoot.

I guess that's it for now! Stay cool!
