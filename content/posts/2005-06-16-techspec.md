I have a wonderful announcement to make today!

I have officially joined the team of writers over at an up and coming tech related website known as [Techspec](http://thetechspec.blogspot.com)! I'm really excited by this because of the drive behind the people making this website. It's not much to look at at the moment because we've just gotten started, but I can assure you that this could very well become a website you will want to bookmark.

I'm looking to write my first article pretty soon for the site and it should be a good one! So keep an eye on [the site](http://thetechspec.blogspot.com) and enjoy the articles written by some very talented people.
