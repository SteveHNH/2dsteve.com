Wow! Blogger now allows you to upload images directly to your blog! No more screwing around with Hello or anything. I really didn't like that program anyway. It seemed like such an inefficient way of getting your pictures on your blog. I always just used [photobucket](http://www.photobucket.com) but this makes things much easier! Thanks Blogger!

Above is yet another banner for Steve and Lando's On the Go Web Show created by Stephanie. Add it to you blog or your signature on message boards. Just put it anywhere you can think of! Later!
