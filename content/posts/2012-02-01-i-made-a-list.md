I made a list of stuff I want to accomplish. It's not a full list of everything that I EVER want to accomplish, but it's a start. I was realizing here lately that I haven't been following through on some of the things that I've been trying to do for a year. I've been talking about launching a new podcasts, getting my RHCSA, getting a HAM Radio license, and various other things without actually doing any of them. The idea of making a list is that I can have it staring back at me until I accomplish it. It's not a fool-proof plan, but it's the best I can do at the moment.

I actually have made some headway on a few things. Actually, writing in this blog is a small victory in itself. Among other things, I'm going to try to write more, exercise and start managing my game time a little better. Because I'm addicted to Star Wars: The Old Republic and I need boundaries 0_o.

It's late now and I need to get some sleep. I think I spent too much time watching videos while trying to blog and I've completely lost track of everything I was going to say. Oh well, this thing is for me anyway ;)
