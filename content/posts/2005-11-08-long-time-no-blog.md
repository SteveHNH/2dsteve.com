Man, I didn't realize it had been so long since I've blogged about anything. I hope you guys missed me because I know I missed you. :)

I really have no excuses for my long absence except that I work and then come home and play WoW. I see now how easy it is for Lando not to update his blog. I really don't want to get into that kind of rut though so I'm going to try and be better about my blogging practices!

Nothing much has really happened worth blogging about though. I did make a really cool purchase last night though! I bought space on a web server!! Yes, I have a BIG project in the works right now. I'm going to be trying to build a tech site with my opinions on today's happenings in gadgets and tech in general. I already bought the domain name which I will be revealing in the coming weeks when I get the site set up and ready to display some content. I don't know how much will be on there but I'm going to try to post a few cool things per day. It really depends on if I can access it from work and if I can have some time to research new stuff. I'm still going to be running this blog and you guys will always be able to find me at this address but I'm also going to be doing this news site on the side. Fun Stuff!!!

I got the server through [ReadySetConnect ](http://www.readysetconnect.com/)and they seem to be a pretty good place. They had a good deal on the server anyway. They also have a ton of auto-install scripts for various things like Bulletin Boards, Content Management Systems, Blogs, and even E-commerce stuff. I'm mostly focused on the CMS stuff though. I'm probably going to be throwing a [Ventrilo ](http://www.ventrilo.com/)server on there for my [WoW ](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/)guild, but that's the only off the wall thing I'll be doing I think.

Well that's the news for now, and I'll keep you guys updated on how things are giong with the server. Right now I'm just waiting for an IP so I can get in a do some damage!
