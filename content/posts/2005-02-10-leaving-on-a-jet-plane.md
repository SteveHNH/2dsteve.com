Tomorrow I set off on the journey to the snowy world of West Virginia! I have to get on two airplanes to get there but, man, am I ready! Woo!! Stephanie here I come! heck yeah! So yeah, this post is basically to say not to expect too much out of me until Monday! Happy Valentine's Day...yeah its early, but if ABC Family can celebrate Valentine's a week early then so can I! Later!
