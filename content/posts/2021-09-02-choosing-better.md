These last two years have taken an enormous amount of things from us. Not stuff, but experiences. It's taken our sense of security, our sense of community, opportunities to get out and enjoy life the way we were meant to, and countless other things that make life worth living. 

Right now, I was expecting to be at DragonCon with *so* many of my buddies that I've met over the last couple years. We were going to have BBQ, attend each other's shows, cause a ruckus, and have a darn good time together. I was really looking forward to that. It's one of the many things I was looking forward to before we were forced back into a lockdown. It's not that we cant' do anything, it's just that I don't do more than I have to. It also means that I don't do anything without giving it considerably more thought than I had to.

But I'm gonna flip the script here. I could spend all my time being bummed about this, or I can do something else.

This week was Sam's second week of Kindergarten. If I had gone to DragonCon today, I'd be missing those drop-offs where he yells "hello" to all his teachers. I'd be missing going through his little folder full of cool stuff that he did that day. I'd be missing the few times I'm going to have where he really wants my attention. Over an entire lifetime, I figure we've got about 10-12 years of each kid before they start not really giving a crap about what we think or do. Not on purpose, but just because they'll end up with their own goals and ideas that they want to chase down. So instead of being at DragonCon, I get to hang out with my little man doing cool stuff this weekend.
