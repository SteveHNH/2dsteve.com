Man, it has been way too long since I've written. I think I'm going to just go ahead and start every post like that. I might as well make it official since that's pretty much what I've been doing ever time I've written for the past few months. It's not that I don't have the time to do it, it's just that I really don't know what to say. But I think I have a handful of things I can actually talk about this time around.

Here's the BIG one: I've been heavily thinking about moving back to West Virginia. It's not an easy decision to come to, especially since I don't have a job up there yet, but it's something that I think I have to do. Stephanie and I have lived apart from each other for 5 years now, and that's just too long for somebody to have to do this. I want to be able to stop missing her all the time, and for us both to be able to share in the simple things that we've missed out on. I can't even call her up and see if she wants to go grocery shopping with me. She's 900 miles away!

This hasn't been an easy decision to come to at all. I don't want to leave all of my friends or my very stable job, but sometimes hard decisions have to be made. I've prayed and prayed and prayed about this, and I feel a peace about it. I couldn't explain it to anybody, because what I want to do is completely illogical and any sane person wouldn't do it. I'm leaving a very well paying job, the most awesome people I've ever met, and my parents, but I feel that this is what I need to do. Stephanie is all that is important in my life, and I don't want to be away from her anymore. That's understandable right?

I know I can get a job in Morgantown, but I can't do that from here. So I will be moving up there and then seeking out a good IT job in hopes that I can support myself. And if I'm lucky, I'll be able to support her too so we can finally get married. I'm honestly overwhelmed with happiness whenever I think about being close to her for more than a week. I'm pretty sure whenever this distance thing is finally over that I'll just collapse into a heap of tears with her because we've gone through so much doing this. It's going to take me weeks just to get used to it. I love her so much.

There is really so much I look forward to in moving up there. I can make Horseshoes & Hand Grenades a better show because me and Ash won't have to use Skype anymore. The quality can improve, and we can start work on our book. It's so hard to collaborate from so far away. I think this is going to turn both me and Stephanie's worlds upside-down, but I think that's what we need. We're so used to not having to struggle for anything, but I think that going through this will make us better people and more prepared for the curveballs life can throw.

I don't expect anybody who knows me to really feel what I do about this. It's something that I can't explain, and something that nobody who isn't in the situation can ever feel. It's just love. It's an unexplainable thing that you can never understand until you actually have it yourself. Steph and I are a team, back to back against everything that comes at us. We look at the world with the idea that in the end, the only person we'll have to lean on is each other. She's all I'll ever need to be happy, regardless of whatever situation we're in.

Anyway, that's just an update on what's been going on in my mind lately. I've been doing most of my blogging on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/stevehnh) which is half the reason I haven't posted many long things on this blog. Maybe I'll get better at it. Once I get rolling on my moving plan I'll post a little bit to let you guys know how it's all going. Wish me luck!!
