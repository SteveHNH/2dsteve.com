I learned how to do this today! I'm so excited over it...I don't know why, because I'll probably never do it again. But for today. Here is a song and a video to go along with it. It's the greatest song ever. Brings a tear to me eye!

Existentialism on Prom Night - Straylight Run

(Video Removed because its annoying listening to your own music and then getting so rudely interrupted by someone elses on a website. Yeah...it was fun for a minute or 5)

I leave for WV tomorrow! It's gonna be awesome man. Lando's picking me up at the airport then we're getting mcdonald's...hopefully...then it's straight on to Princeton to see Stephanie. I'm kind of nervous about my flight because of what happened last week, but I'm sure everything will turn out fine this time around. I hope so anyway. We're gonna play some Mario Party 6 man! I love that game. Okay well I love the Mario Party series. I haven't actually played Mario Party 6 yet, but the other ones were great. Well Mario Party 5 sucked, but 4 was awesome! Maybe they won't let me down with 6. WarioWare Inc. is an awesome game too, more spastic....actually its more my speed than mario party because I'm kind of a spazzy guy. I like speed.
Well I'm gonna sit here and play [ebaums](http://www.ebaumsworld.com/) games and what not. You guys be cool!
