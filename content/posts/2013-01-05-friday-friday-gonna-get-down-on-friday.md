Someone kill me for getting that song stuck in my head.

I promised myself that I would blog everyday, and I'm not going to let being sick and tired on a Friday night stop me from my goal. That being said, I have no idea what to talk about. I ate at out at Outback tonight with Stephy, Smashface, and Jefferson. Smashy and Jeff got here tonight to hang out with us this evening and into tomorrow. I'm glad they're here because they're pretty cool folks! That's a lie... I love them unconditionally. That's truth.Â <!-- more -->

It's always fun hanging with Smashy because she's a nerd too, so we get all excited and geek out over the same things. Especially Batman. I dig me some Batman.

Oh! Here's something that actually has some relevance to my everyday life. I started using an app called Todoist on my phone and on the web. It's a really killer to-do list app that helps me stay organized. I don't know what it is about to-do list, but they add a sense of purpose and accountability to mundane things that I normally would just shrug off. This blog has even benefitted from it a bit. I set a to-do for "write in my blog" to be done everyday. I get all proud when I get to mark that checkbox. I just find that it helps me out a lot to have this list because I'm so ADD about everything, it keeps me on track a bit. It's not the alpha and omega of productivity, but it's helping. I guess we'll just have to see how long I can keep it up. So far, so good.

I even have some things to think about this weekend that need done. Like learning to code some more stuff. I've been playing around a lot with PHP, MySQL, and Javascript. There is SO much that can be done with a couple JS frameworks. Unfortunately, I know J&S about JS so I have a long way to go. I have an issue where I try to run before I can walk and that's causing some problems. At least I'm trying. I could have just given up a long time ago.

Good news, blog! Time for bed!
