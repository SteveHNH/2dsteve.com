Oh yeah!! I'm giong to see [Jimmy Eat World](http://www.purevolume.com/jimmyeatworld) and [Underoath](http://www.purevolume.com/underoath) in concert tonight at FSU! Heck yeah!

This concert is totally free and I'm all excited. I just hope I can find a parking spot and get close enough to the stage for it to mean something. It's an outside deal too so that's gonna be awesome. Plenty of room for people.

I just felt like sharing that awesome news with you guys. I also might be audioblogging from the event so look forward to hearing my random excited voice tonight. Unless, I don't audioblog...then you can just forget I said this altogether. Later!
