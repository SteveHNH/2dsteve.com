](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/superman-jimlee.jpg")I had to fly today, and I've decided that it's just way too inconvenient to have to use a machine to do it. If there is ever a time that I wish I was Superman, it's times when I have to get on a plane and go somewhere. Wouldn't it be nice to just jump off the ground and zip to your destination without having to rely on anyone else or battle through security checkpoints? I dream of a day when we all have flying cars. At such time I will start dreaming of the day that we drive on the ground again because we've given all the idiots who couldn't drive a straight line a 3D space to move around in. Maybe the flying is best left to professionals after all.

I actually didn't have that hard of a time flying to Florida and I'm really just glad I made it on the DAY I intended to make it on. I thought I was going to be in a lot of trouble because my flight in Pittsburgh was delayed. I thought for sure that I would miss my connecting flight, or at least have to run down the concourse in order to find it. I had neither a seat nor a gate number for my flight to Tallahassee from Memphis. I ended up not having to run at all though! Despite my flight being late on the ground, the gate for my flight to Tally was right across the hall. I had to walk a grand total of 10 feet :). Only to realize that once I got there, the plane was delayed for about 45 minutes.

I don't know what it was with the flights today, but they were all out of sync. Each flight was delayed pretty much because another flight had run into trouble, or had not arrived yet. I can only hope that my flight home goes much smoother than this one did. I guess it's unfair to say that these flights didn't go smoothly because all in all I had a very pleasant trip. The delays just freak me out.

Don't ask me why I call it that, because I'm really not sure why. I ended up getting some pretty awesome stuff and I'm very excited about it! I got some good books, Rachel Ray cooking tools (relax, i'm not gay), a book light, some freakin' awesome pants, Iron Man on Blu-Ray, a new Garmin GPS, and other miscellaneous awesome things. My parents do way too much for me, but I really do appreciate it all. My Garmin got stolen earlier this year so that was a very welcome gift.

I hope everybody had a wonderful Christmas and got to spend some valuable, quality time with family and friends. Speaking of which, I'm going to sleep so I can actually wake up and enjoy some of that time tomorrow :)
