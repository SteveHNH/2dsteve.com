It was a whirlwind of a day, but I've officially moved my blog over to a static website. No more databases, no more wordpress, no more shared server. The cool thing about this is that I don't really have to worry over database stuff or if I have a backup. The whole website lives in a Git repository, which means it's just ... out there. There's no real need for me to do anything special to keep it. If I get really paranoid, I can just pull the thing on occasion and drop a backup on the NAS in my house, or on a server, or whatever. 

Man, this is **flexible**.

I have my good buddy, [Chris](https://www.chriscollins.is), to thank for giving me the idea. He was messing around with a platform called Hugo, and I'm a nerd so I decided to give it a go. It's actually super nice and easy to work with. I've used a few static generated site platforms in the past, but they all left something to be desired with the "ease of use" category. This one checks a lot of boxes for me.

I really like that I can post everything using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's a simple syntax to learn and allows you to write quickly without worrying about much. I write a ton of docs in MD at work, so this is just a natural extension.

I'll get back to writing at a steady clip soon. I'm likely to post some moving foward if for nothing else just to enjoy writing without all the hubbub.
