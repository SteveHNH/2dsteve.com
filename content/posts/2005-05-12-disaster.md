I stumbled across this really fun page today while browsing [ScopeTech's](http://www.scopetech.net) message boards. It's a site called [NetDisaster](http://www.netdisaster.com) that lets you annihilate any web pages you want with a click of a mouse! I was playing with it and totally destroyed my page using dinosaurs, martians, and spilled coffee! It's really reminiscent of that old "destroy your desktop" game that we all loved so much, except that this lets you do it to any webpage you want to! So [go destroy something](http://www.netdisaster.com)! It's fun!
