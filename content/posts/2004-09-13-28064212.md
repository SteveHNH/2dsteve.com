Hey everybody! Man, I'm in class and was a little bored so I thought I would leave a post! I watched Donnie Darko yesterday. Man that was a coooool movie. It was all weird and twisted and stuff. I watched it before but yesterday I really watched it. It was really good. Well, man, I thought I had more to say...turns out I don't.
I got new glasses. yeah they're cool. thats about it. I got a tick bite too. Maybe I won't get lyme disease becuase that would be gross. I also got a 96 on my test in class today. Thats good news!! I think we are going to flee this hurricane and go to Alabama. That'll be cool I suppose. Going anywhere that we aren't going to get blown away is cool.  Alright, thats it, I'm done. Take it easy!
