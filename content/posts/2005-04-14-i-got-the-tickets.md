OH YEAH! I just got done ordering my tickets for...STAR WARS: EPISODE III

I am so freakin' excited for this movie. Tickets went on sale at AMC Theatres today and I totally got the tickets and I'm all ready for the midnight show! I've been scared to death that I wasn't going to be able to get tickets but thanks to theforce.net ... the best site for Star Wars news... I got informed that AMC was selling them. So as of today, I am officially going to the midnight show of Star Wars.

I've heard a lot of people say that this is going to be the best movie yet, in the new trilogy anyway, but they don't exactly have much to beat. I think it's going to be sweet though! Ewan McGregor (obi-wan kenobi) actually liked the script which is a surprise considering he hasn't been too excited about the last two movies, and Francis Ford Copolla (long time buddy of George Lucas) said he feels that sequels should not be made but he exludes this movie from that rule.

I'm so freakin' excited I can't hardly type.

On a side note, the new ATTICUS compilation is great, has its bad songs, but the good ones are really really good. And I'm Network+ certified now! WOOHOO!
