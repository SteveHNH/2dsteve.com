I'm really annoyed at blogger at the moment. I could have sworn I wrote a new post and published it last night, only today I find that it doesn't exist. Did I simply dream up a post and then not type it out, or did blogger erase it somehow. Either way, I know I wrote a post and put it somewhere. Maybe I'm finally losing my mind. I guess all the days spent wasting time in front of this monitor is starting to get to my brain.

I have been so ridiculously busy this week it's stupid. I have another Microsoft exam to study for, a quiz in my security class, a podcast to record, a fence to finish building, and company to entertain. Today is way too packed full of stuff. I'm trying to get everyone to understand that this podcast me and [Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) do is very important and we're trying to be professional. Sometimes I think that every thinks it's just a game.

I think I need to go study for my exam now. Later.

UPDATE: I did lose a post somewhere! I don't know what happened to it but it's bugging me. I distinctly remember looking at it last night and it's gone now. I had a line in it about [steveandlando.com](http://www.steveandlando.com) and then a part where I said "it rules you" and it was all written in red. Time to change my password >_
