](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/alarmclock.jpg)I've been getting up at 6:00am every morning this week in an attempt to give myself more time to eat a solid breakfast, read a bit of the Bible, and just have a more leisurely morning in general. Unfortunately, I haven't been going to bed earlier the night before. This has basically worn me down night after night for the whole week. Tonight I'm just dead tired. I didn't blog last night because we had the show and it was late by the time I got done with it. I figure I can use the show as my Thursday night blog session considering I ramble about everything going on in my life then anyway.

I really have enjoyed my mornings this week though, despite me not getting a whole lot of sleep. Stephy has been getting up with me and making me oatmeal for breakfast so that I have something relatively healthy before I leave in the morning. She makes it with cinnamon, brown sugar, and raisins so it's not nearly as bland. It's great. I sit and read a chapter of the Bible while I eat my oatmeal and it just gets my day started right. I wish my brain was warmed up enough to take more of it in, but I do try to remember what that morning's chapter was about.

Today marked the end of the project I'm on at work that kept me down in the bullpen with a bunch of other people. I'm kind of sad that it's over because I've had a really good time with all of those wonderful people down there. I haven't been in a bullpen environment in a while so it was nice to get back to that for a bit. I honestly wouldn't mind if they told us they wanted us down there for another week. I hate to say it, but I felt more at home down in the operations center than I do in my own office. And my office has my comic art on the wall!

I'm so sleep I can barely keep my eyes open. I'm going to try to finish _The Name of the Wind_ tonight though. I only have about 50 pages left before I reach the end. It's so exciting! I'm going straight to B&N tomorrow if I finish this book tonight. I need the next one so very bad. I'll miss Kvothe too much if I can't read his life story for a night ;)
