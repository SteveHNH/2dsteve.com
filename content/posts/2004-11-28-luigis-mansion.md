Hey everybody! I'm back from a good Turkey day break. Man was that Thanksgiving dinner good. I love turkey man, and the only time my mom cooks it is on Thanksgiving. It was way better than that one thanksgiving that we spent at Piccadilly's. Its just not that fun eating off of a big buffet line.
Anyway, I'm back now and I have some blogging to do. I finally picked up Stephanie's present and it is awesome. I can't say much here because she reads this, but its awesome. Stephanie you are gonna love it! I hope so anyway. I also decided what to get Lando which is good. So I've got all my present stuff almost taken care of, but I don't know what to get my sister yet. I'll figure that out though. I usually just get her a DVD or something. I know that sounds sad, but she really likes DVD's. We do it for each other becuase we both love movies. I'm hoping I get the Clerks 10th anniversary addition and Chasing Amy to finish off my Kevin Smith Jersey Trilogy. I have Mallrats but never got the others. I have Jersey Girl too, but I've never really wanted Jay and Bob's movie or Dogma. I just don't think I would feel right watching Dogma. I am a Christian, not Catholic mind you, and some stuff in it just bothers me.
Quick Note: Go listen to My Chemical Romance...they're awesome
I finally went and rented Luigi's Mansion. Man that game is so fun! It's so simple but its so cool!! I love the whole vacuum thing! Its awesome. The graphics in the game are very impressive. Its all cartoony and stuff. And it makes it 10 times better since it's Luigi that you are playing as. I was always one of those kids who wanted to be 2nd player in Mario just so I could be Luigi. I thought he was way cooler than Mario. He never got the credit he deserved until now. I think I'm gonna beat Luigi's Mansion way too fast though. It's really easy and I'm already halfway through and I just rented it today. Maybe I won't beat it too fast. Well anyway, I guess I'll stop rambling now. You guys take it easy!!
