Finally! After over a year of frustration and no doubt some really angry emails, G4 has finally caved in and is planning to bring Call for Help and Leo Laporte back to US Television! It seems to me that maybe they've finally realized they made a huge mistake letting Leo and the show go. That show was one of my favorites on TechTV because it explained all the crap I didn't understand, and also gave me another place to see Leo do his thing.

These will be the new episodes, not reruns of old episodes. I'm so excited about this because I haven't seen it since it moved to Canada. A lot of people have through the use of torrent sites but unfortunately I don't have that luxury. Files are too big :(

Anyway, I thought that was newsworthy. I have to go write an article explaining my classes hacking exploits..later!
