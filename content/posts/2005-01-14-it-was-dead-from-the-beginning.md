Looks like G4 is finally pulling the plug on the TechTV name. They have a press release posted on [their site ](http://www.g4techtv.com)saying that they are going back to their only video games policy. They are bringing out some new shows like "Girls Gone Wired".....yeah that sad. It's like a video game girl beauty contest or something. It's disgusting. Read the[ Press Release](http://www.g4techtv.com/html/about/press/showrelease.asp?pressrelease_key=64) here.
