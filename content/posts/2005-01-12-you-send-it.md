HEY HEY HEY! I found this new service that I felt like telling you guys about. I heard about it a long time ago but never actually had a use for it until now. It's called [YouSendIt](http://s3.yousendit.com/) and it lets you send a file of up to 1 GB to a location so someone else can download it. It's pretty much like emailing a file but it lets you email HUGE files. They go to a server where they will reside for a while and whoever you send the link to can go and download the file. Its really neat. So I've decided to implement this feature into my blog and let you guys send me cool things that you find, like movies, music, games, or other things you think are really cool. You can click the link at the top of the sidebar to send me stuff. If I find things from time to time that I want you guys to see, I'll upload it to [YouSendIt](http://s3.yousendit.com/) and then post the link here. So lets have some fun with this!
