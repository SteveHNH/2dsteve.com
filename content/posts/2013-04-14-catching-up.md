I really let this blog fall to the wayside again. I was doing so well too! Oh well, let's just give this a try again and see where we get this time. I don't feel too bad, but there has been a lot going on and a lot of things that happened that warrant at least one post to catch up on it all. I don't really feel to much like writing or anything, so this may be short. Then again, I tend to type most when I wasn't really in the mood for any of it. Here goes.

The last post that I wrote, I talked about how my grandfather was sick and back in the hospital. After a rollercoaster of an emotional weekend and two trips to Alabama, he passed away. March 13, 2013 was the date. I'm not sure how I was supposed to feel, but in a lot of ways I felt relief that he didn't have to suffer anymore. His breathing was so shallow, he probably weighed 80 pounds soaking wet, and he was just hanging on for the sake of hanging on. He passed away peacefully there in the hospital, and was buried at the Macedonia church cemetary in Alabama.

I actually was given the privilege of leading the funeral service, which was kind of scary but at the same time it may have been the easiest public speaking I'd ever done. I got up in front of family and friends to talk about how awesome my grandfather was and to also comfort them in a time they needed it. I believe that God totally prepared me for that moment, and had been gearing me up for it for at least a few months. He's been pulling me really close and I've seen some amazing things happen in the process. I felt like it was a great opportunity for me to open the lines of conversation with folks about how much God really loves us, and when we as Christians die, it's just God calling us home. It's stuff like that that helps us to deal with death and what's going on when we pass. I firmly believe that's the way it is anyway. I've seen and felt too much to convince me to think otherwise.

That was a pretty big event for all of us, but things have gotten a bit back to normal. I'm not entirely sure how the rest of my extended family is really doing right now, as I'm sure it's a lot different and pretty lonely without him here. We'll get through it just like anything else though. Not that it's easy.

In other news, Stephanie and I have been getting more and more involved in the church and trying to help out. It's been incredibly rewarding for both of us. I'm so glad that we decided to really pick a church and be a part of something there. I've probably gotten  more out of it than I've put in, but it's been so awesome. I ran the video switcher today, which was basically just a hardware version of CamTwist for me to use. I was shocked at how similar the two are. I feel like maybe all the podcasting I've been doing over the years has really prepared me to do this kind of thing. It's amazing  how God can find a way to use all the little hobbies that you have. It's super exciting. I really like helping out there :).

Steph also got a job!! She's working for Walgreen's (not the retail side) and is having a blast with it. I'm so proud of her. It's incredible. We're truly blessed to have finally found a place we love to live, friends we really enjoy hanging with, and jobs we really like. It took us a while to get here, but we did it! Life's good so far, man. There's a speed bump or two along the way, but that's just the way it is. Always look to the brighter side and dwell on positive things, that way nothing will get you down. :)
