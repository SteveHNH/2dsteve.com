Michael Jackson is not guilty.

He was cleared of everything, and to be honest I think it was a good call. Now before you go judging me and thinking I'm a psycho, I do think Michael Jackson is in need of some serious psychiatric help. But I think that the people who brought the charges against him were a little on the shady side, so it was hard to believe what they said. I do think he's messed up, but I don't think that he would molest any little kids. The guy is just a harmless old weirdo who climbs trees and moonwalks. Give him a break.

While I'm thinking about this I thought that I would inform everyone of this heartbreaking news. Andrew McMahon, lead singer of Something Corporate, has been diagnosed with Acute Lymphatic Leukemia. This is really a terrible thing to happen to such a young guy. My thoughts and prayers go out to him and his family. He says he appreciates the flowers and cards that he's recieved from fans, but any donations you wish to make he says should go to his charity of choice. You can find out more from their website: [SomethingCorporate.com](http://www.somethingcorporate.com).
