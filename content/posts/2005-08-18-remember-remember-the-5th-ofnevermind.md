So it seems that V for Vendetta, the new movie from the Wachowski brothers (of Matrix fame) and Joel Silver, isn't going to come out on the 5th of November as they said. Now it's coming out in March of 2006. I'm really sad about this because that was a super catchy phrase to help you remember when it comes out.

"Remember, Remember the 5th of November"

Now how cool is that!! Now what do they do! I'm still going to go see it in March of next year but now I just have to remember a poem. This movie looks sooo cool! I like the idea of defying the government..it just sounds awesome. Revolutions are cool!

Eh, not earth shattering news I know, but it's news nonetheless! If you don't know what I'm talking about then you should go check out the [trailer for it here](http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=7810). Later!
