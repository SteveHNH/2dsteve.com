Well I TiVo'ed the new Screen Savers and I have but one thing to say...... THAT WAS THE WORST EPISODE OF TSS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE TECHTV WATCHING LIFE!!! Seriously!!!! The audience was dead silent, nobody likes the new kevin guy...we hate chi-lan. BRING BACK ALEX MAN!! Apparently Alex didn't like it either, check out his[ blog here](http://www.alexalbrecht.com). It really sucks. I'll never watch the show again. Later.
