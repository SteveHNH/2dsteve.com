](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/2578173389_12b1a665ce.jpg)I decided as of last Friday that I was done with soda. Landon and I walked into an A&W restaurant and I drank the last soft drink I will be having for a long time. What better thing to end with than a draft root beer from A&W?! I know it sounds crazy and I'm sure that won't be the total last soft drink that I have, but I've decided that I will do my best to shy away from soda as much as I can. I've probably had at least two sodas a day since I was 7. Maybe even before that but I can't be totally sure. That makes this a pretty tough decision because I love it so much. Sometimes a Coke is just SO good. I don't know of anything else you can eat a hot dog or tacos with. Water just won't cut it in those instances.

I also decided that I'm going to do my best to start running on the elliptical machine at Steph's apartment. I got up at 5:30 this morning so that I could do it and managed to run on it for about ten minutes. I know that doesn't sound like a long time, but considering I don't do a whole lot, that felt like a good while. That thing is brutal! I'm trying to work up to getting thirty minutes a day, but that's going to take some more time. I guess it's all about baby steps, and this is a pretty good start if you ask me.

Now I think I'm going to get to bed early tonight because 5:30 was way too early this morning. I'm going to watch some TV and then sleep. I really need to find some time to play World of Warcraft. I haven't played in a long time, and I'm not sure that I even remember how!
