If you have ever wanted to experience instrumental euphoria, I strongly suggest taking a listen to Straylight Run's "Your Name Here (Sunrise Highway)". I have to say that this is one of the most beautiful songs that I have heard in quite some time. If you haven't heard this band, listen to them. Stream some of the album at [www.victoryrecords.com](http://www.victoryrecords.com), or go to [www.straylightrun.com](http://www.straylightrun.com) and stream the old demo cd. They just released their self- titled full length debut album on October 12th and I highly doubt any stores will get it in, but they need too. No band has made music that made me feel the way that this band does. There's just something about it that amazes me. A lot of people might not like it, but I urge you to at least listen to that one song, or just give them a chance. They are truly amazing.
