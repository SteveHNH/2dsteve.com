Horseshoes & Hand Grenades has officially added a blog to our already news filled podcast. I've got some really awesome ideas about this thing. I want to be able to provide our listeners with stuff that they can enjoy all week long and not have to wait til Friday to learn about stuff. Ash and I will be posting random tidbits that we come up with throughout the week and also stuff that might not quite fit at all. The site is totally done or anything, but we'll be working on it to make it awesome and make sure it is a bookmark in your browser.

If you run a blog and you want to help us out, do us a favor and link to us! We'll always be working hard to make sure we have quality content and are worth reading :) . Thanks!!
