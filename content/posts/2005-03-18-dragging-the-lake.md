Has anyone picked up the new Atticus comp? It looks like there are some good bands on it.

Anyway! I was perusing the internet today (peruse is a good word), and I stumbled across a really cool downloadable TV show about a group of hackers that call themeselves "[The Scene](http://www.welcometothescene.com)". It's actually a pretty cool show so far. The first episode is extremely simple, in that it just involves a guy sitting at his computer typing on [IRC](http://www.mirc.com) and ripping a DVD, but I must say that I am captivated. This hacker group is responsible for ripping unreleased DVD's and putting them on the internet. It's a really cool peek into the underground that I'm sure none of us are ever involved in *wink, wink, nudge, nudge*. I'm definitely gonna download some more episodes. It definitely is worth checking out if you want to. I urge you to use a [Bittorrent client](http://azureus.sourceforge.net/) to download it because the standard Web Link is definitely not as fast. They have 5 episodes out right now, so that's definitely a start. This should tide us over until [Kevin](http://www.kevinrose.com) and the gang launch their new show and the return of [TheBroken](http://www.thebroken.org).

My good buddy Karl informed me of a much better image hosting option that[ imagehosting.us](http://www.imagehosting.us). It's called [PhotoBucket](http://www.photobucket.com). It's not that much of a step up from imagehosting.us but it is a tad bit better in some ways. They give you 25mb to store your photos, same as [imagehosting](http://www.imagehosting.us), but they give you 1.5GB of bandwidth a month. For you non-geeks out there, it basically means that someone can refresh a 1MB picture 1500 times before the site won't let it be seen anymore. Definitely great if you have a high traffic website. The only downside to this enormous amount of bandwidth is that they only let you upload 250k pictures. So no picture bigger than that can be used. I don't think I'll ever have a picture that is bigger than 250k, but if I do I'll turn to [imagehosting.us](http://www.imagehosting.us) because I haven't heard of such a limit with them.

Well that's about it for my interesting news today. I'm listening to [Alkaline Trio](http://www.alkalinetrio.com/), I haven't listened to them in a while so it's very refreshing. The whole satanic thing is stupid, but a lot of their music is really awesome. Don't know if I'll get their new cd, it just all depends. It's called "Church and Destroy".....I don't quite like that title. Maybe it will be good...if it's too dark and angry I might not get it. It all depends. BE COOL!

Random Thought: There's a guy in one of my classes that refers to Links on the internet as HyperLinks...yes that is in truth what they are called, but who calls them that now? I think he wants to sound smart...it's not working.
