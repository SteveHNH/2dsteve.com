Every now and then you just have to do something different. Whether that be just driving to work a different way, listening to different music, or wearing socks on your hands, it's important that you change it up every now and then. Today I set out to do just that, and I bought myself a handful of new shirts. You may be asking, "Why is it so different that you bought shirts?" To which I will reply, "They have stripes on them!"

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/P1010394.jpg)If you've known me for any amount of time, you'll know that I'm a big fan of solid colors. I wear pretty much navy blue, green, sometimes red, green, and orange. They are simple colors that are somewhat bright and easy to match with my khaki pants. However, I've decided that I really need to change up my style because I was getting pretty bored of picking out the same old shirts week after week. I went Â out on a limb today while Steph and I were at Kohl's registering, and I picked up some really looking shirts. She really picked out most of them, I just approved. I will definitely take the credit for the orange and blue one though, because I thought about Auburn University colors and HAD to have it. I'm very proud of myself.

I usually have a major anxiety problem when it comes to shopping for new clothes. I always freak out and I can't even begin to explain why. I'm just not comfortable shopping for clothes. I never have been. I do better in department stores than I do in places like The Gap though, and I'm not really sure why. I've never identified myself with a brand and I feel like shopping at the store might very well do that to me. It really lingers on from my days as a staunch opponent to brand shopping. Just a kick-back to my punk rock days I suppose. I've never really have been able to get over it, for unexplained reasons, and I'm unsure that I ever will. I did feel pretty good after getting through a shopping session and actually buying something.

Maybe all of it really comes from a slight social anxiety disorder that I have. Which you wouldn't think I would have seeing as I host a podcast weekly with dozens of listeners and occasional call-ins. I only really get nervous when I'm put in a situation that I don't feel that I'm in control of. This is why I have problems calling people on the phone, or approaching people in a store. I really need to get over this soon.

Well, thanks for reading a blog post that turned from simple excitement over a few new shirts into a self-examination of my social issues. Blogging is incredibly therapeutic! By the way, the new Alkaline Trio cd "This Addiction" is FANTASTIC!
