Okay, I know how ridiculous this all sounds but it's actually very addictive. I played with this thing for like 2 hours this morning during class. You can put Steve Jobs in various outfits ranging from a Pimp to a Pirate. It's really awesome so [go play with it](http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/692flash.html).
