In case you didn't notice when you pointed your browser to your favorite site in the whole world, I got a new template!

I decided to mozy on over to Blogger Templates the other day and see if they had anything new and exciting, because I was getting bored of the white and blue thing. And lo and behold, they had a ton of cool new templates! I was thinking about going with the new version of Kubrick, my previous template, but I thought it was time for a change. So here you are, the new face of Full Tang Ninja's House of Mojo! I really like the colors on this page. It's just so easy on the eyes and soothing...or at least I think so.

I've moved pretty much everything over to this new look, but I left the buttons, the flickr badge, the online status indicators, and the Google Search off. I just decided all that crap was cluttering my sidebar and I didn't need it anyway. Actually, I would like to have the search because my blog is so huge now, but I need to see if Google has a transparent search thing because the white on this looked stupid. 

One good thing about this template is that I can see who comments without having to pretend I'm posting a new one. That's the one thing I didn't like about the old one. So now your name should show up when you post a comment. I still like having my comments in a pop up window though. And until I get spammed like my buddies Patrick and Landon, then you won't be having to type in some goofy confirmation word. I like to make the comment process as easy as possible.

Well anyway, that's it for now! Just thought I'd share my thoughts of this grand occasion with you guys! 

By the way, I wrote this entire article using my incredibly awesome Mac OS X...on Intel. Oh yeah!
