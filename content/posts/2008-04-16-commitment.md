It's been a long time since I've written anything of any kind in this blog and for that, I apologize. I'm starting to realize that I may not be that "all the time" writer that a lot of people can be. I really wish I could dedicate a lot of time to this little blog and make it the best blog it can be but I just can't seem to make myself sit down and write in it very often. It's not that I lack a lot of things to say, it's just that I don't know how to express them. The sad thing is that I sit down and start typing, and everything I ever could possibly want to say starts flowing onto the page. Maybe I need a schedule?

I'm the kind of person that can't commit to anything unless I have it written down. I'm notorious for planning out stuff and then completely forgetting about it. I have done that multiple times in just the course of this week. I get calls from people, promise to call them back, and the completely forget about it until a totally inopportune moment, and then I can't call. It's ridiculous! To all those people who may be reading this and have fallen victim to my sad ability of calling people back, I apologize. I would say that I will try to do better, but I know good and well that I probably won't. That sucks.

In other news, I just got done reading the shooting script of "Juno" and I think I may have to pick up more screenplays from my favorite movies. Once you read a movie, you realize how much work and effort went into bring the paper to life. I can't imagine writing an entire movie and then seeing my characters brought to life by people I've always admired, or people who just genuinely do the character justice. I admire every single screenwriter out there for taking the time to dream up some of these works and then get them pushed through Hollywood's gauntlet and into a theatre near us. I've written one movie before, and it was just a 15 minute horror film that was, in all reality, pathetic. I'm proud of it anyway though, because it is something that I took upon myself and actually finished.

Here's to finishing things we start. Something I may someday be good at...or maybe not.
