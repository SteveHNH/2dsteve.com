Oh yeah man! I took my Installing, Configuring, and Administering Windows XP test today and I totally passed! I'm too excited over it because now I'm a Microsoft Certified Professional! That test was actually pretty hard too. It was mostly about maintaining Windows XP Pro clients in an Active Directory network. I thought it was just going to be about simple things like control panel and how to install an operating system, but they went really deep. The questions went into stuff like deployment of XP over the network, and setting permissions on shared folders. But it had it's simple stuff too, I just can't seem to remember any of those examples.

My heart was beating so fast at the end of the exam before I pressed the End Exam button. I was all freaking out man! Because I knew that on the next page would be my Pass or Fail grade and I really wasn't sure if I was going to pass, but I did! Now I have access to this Microsoft member website, they'll send me software discounts, I'll get invitations to conferences, plus a certification like this will definitely help me find a job.

This test was only the first in a series I have to take to get MCSA certified. I have to take like 5 more I believe, but I'm sure I'll be able to do it. Just thought I'd share with the world the joy of being a Professional at something! Take it easy!
