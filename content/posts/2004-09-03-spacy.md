I found an interesting commentary just now about the implausibility of having a trash compactor on the Death Star. The guy brings up a lot of good points. yep, this is just for you guys who care at all.

 I also found this other super cool thing! If you've ever wanted to make something out of your old floppy disk, check out this creative art piece. It's like oragami with plastic.
