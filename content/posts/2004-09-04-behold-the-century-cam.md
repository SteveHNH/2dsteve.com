I found an interesting article as I was roaming the internet! Good ol' Sam Raimi (director of Spider-man movies and, of course,  Evil Dead) has decided that he wants to keep making movies long into the future.....about 1,000 years!! He's come up with what he calls the "century cam"...which oddly enough will record the United States from above for a....millenium? Yes, a century cam that records for a millenium. Doesn't make SENSE, but it just wouldn't sound as cool without the alliteration. [Check it Out](http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/06/29/film.raimi.centurycam.ap/index.html).
