I found out a really cool thing as I sat here in school browsing the internet. It turns out that a lot of people that are into film making also several other hobbies that are in common with mine. Most of them like indie rock, writing, internet, web design, and graphic design and stuff. That was really cool to learn and I just though you guys should know. Maybe you should browse through blogs of people who share your same interests and you'll find people who like lots of the same things you do. Its so cool, because a lot of people who like film making also like Tim Burton. I love Tim Burton....someone make a movie with me.
