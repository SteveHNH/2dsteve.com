I did it!

I stepped on the scale yesterday and I'm down six pounds in a week. That might not seem like a lot, but given that I really only need to lose about twenty or so, that's 25% of my goal. I'm excited about it because I wasn't really tryign that hard. I know this isn't the story a lot of people face, but I'm grateful for this small improvement regardless. I notice when I'm twenty pounds over, and I think that matters.

Here's to another week of trying to keep up the momentum!
