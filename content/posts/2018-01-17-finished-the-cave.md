I finished the cave on **The Adventures of Stephen** last night. I had a great time playing it with everyone. I played six of the available seven characters. The main reasoning behind that is I can't see playing through it three times with two of the three final characters being those that I already used. I'm definitely gonig to return to it in the future though.

I found out, after the fact of course, that there are a a TON of achievements in this game that there is no chance you would figure out on your own. I really want to get at least a few of them, and the game is fun enough that I could totally go back and play it with these in mind. Like getting **The Good Ending** for instance. I didn't even know this was a thing. I thought all the characters were inherently deplorable and there was no way you could get a positive outcome. Turns out, you can! All you have to do is turn in the items that the clerk gives you at the very end. Don't leave the cave with the stuff you get and you successfully redeem yourself.

This game is a primary example why I want [Ron Gilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Gilbert) to never leave game dev. He always needs to have his voice out there, making games that are fun and unique. It's not that no one has ever done a platformer, it's just that the dialogue and style are all his. You can spot one of his games from a mile away. I would gladly buy one of his small indie games over most AAA games any day.

Next week, we're moving on to Grim Fandango! My favorite adventure game of all time. I can't wait to play it again.
