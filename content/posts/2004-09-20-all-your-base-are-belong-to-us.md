Hey everybody! Man, its been a long time since I've posted anything. As many of you may have guessed, I got Fable and have been playing it pretty much all weekend haha. Its the coooooolest game in the world. I started a game being all benevolent and giving and stuff. Its great. People just flock to me and everyones in love with me, and I have blonde hair haha. Somehow goodness = blonde hair, I don't know why. They were seriously right about how you play the game effects your body type and stuff. I have some ripped muscles and scars all over from the battles I've been in. Its soooo cool! I got some tattoos too.  I really wish I could take a screenshot of it, but its on xbox. Oh well!
Also, I got a chance to play Doom 3 finally. Its AWESOME! It totally freaked me out the first time I played so I stopped and went to play Fable, but then I came back and played it some more. You feel totally immersed in the game and stuff. It almost feels like yoru there, especially with surround sound speakers. The graphics are seriously the best part of the game though, that and sound. It is the most beautiful game that I have ever seen...well...beautiful in that twisted, hellish sort of way. But beautiful nonetheless.
I've also been volunteering as the light board operator at the Tallahassee Little Theatre. That's been really fun so far. I got to work the light board last night for the first time and it wasn't really all that hard. It's a super awesome play too. It's a comedy and its really really funny. If any of you are intersted in what its about you can google it I guess, because I don't have a link to it. The play is called "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum". Its hilarious. It's a musical but there is a lot of dialogue. I'm not usually one to enjoy musicals but I love this play. The actors are amazing too.
Well this post is getting way too long. Catch you guys later!
