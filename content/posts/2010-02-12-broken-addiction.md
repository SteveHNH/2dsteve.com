That's right! I haven't logged on a single time for anything, and I can't be more happy about it. I know a lot of you are probably thinking, "Why is that such a big deal? Video games are dumb," but I don't think you understand this game. [World of Warcraft](http://www.worldofwarcraft.com) has over 11 million people playing and is one of the most successful, long-running Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games of all time. There are so many people that are addicted to this game, it's ridiculous. [People in China have died](http://www.joystiq.com/2005/11/04/wow-online-funeral-commemorates-death-of-young-gamer/) in coffee shops from playing too much...well that and not drinking water.

I played on and off for about for 4 years or so, but finally got into it pretty hardcore last year. I was playing almost every night, and making time to play so that I could join my buds in slaying the evil beasts of Azeroth. This isn't all bad, but when it costs 15 bucks a month and you know you could be doing other things, it can be an issue. I'm all for playing video games and having a blast. I mean, look at my last post about Dragon Age. But, since quitting WoW, I was able to get my Linux+ certification and I'm well on my way to Security+ as well. I'm all for earning fun virtual stuff, but earning real life stuff is so much more satisfying.

I finally deleted the game completely off my computer about a month ago in hopes that it would never return. I had a blast playing it, but now I don't miss it at all. Even when I think about the upcoming expansion, it really doesn't get me too excited for the game. I'm definitely going to pick up something new in the future but for now I'm just enjoying some extra time to blog and enjoy some of my other hobbies... at least until [Star Wars: The Old Republic](http://www.swtor.com) comes out.
