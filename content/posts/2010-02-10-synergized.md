I'm just going to come right out and say it:

**The internet is getting freaking ridiculous! **

I mean, honestly, how many different social networking, news commenting, bookmarking, content distribution web sites does one internet need?! I'm sure by now that most of you who use a Gmail account have noticed that Google has opted you into a new service it has called Buzz. This is not going to be a "Buzz hating" post, because I actually think the service is kind of neat. My problem is that Buzz is just another cog in this ridiculous machine that does the same thing as some other service and even interconnects with that same service. Do we really need another status updating service to keep track of?

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/how-to-use-the-internet.jpg)I am one of the many highly connected people that live and work on the internet. I use Twitter, Blippy, gdgt, Google Wave, Facebook, and I was even a member of Pownce when it was still around. All of these different services can pretty much interconnect with each other in one way or another. The whole "what are you doing?" concept that Twitter came up with is now invading every facet of our internet lives. Some people update Facebook which updates Twitter. I like to update Twitter which updates Facebook. Now we've got Buzz which can update Twitter or receive updates from Twitter. This post is way too hard to write O_o.

I guess the main thing I'm getting to is, how much is too much? I really only bother with Twitter for the most part and I have it update every other connected service. I guess I do that because that is all Twitter is made for. It's the purpose of the service. Whereas Facebook and Buzz have other things they can do. Why would you want to use another service to update Twitter? It just doesn't make sense. I just don't know if I can keep up with an additional service for updated what I'm doing or what I'm thinking about at the time. It's a social stream overload. I want to participate in all of these new tools, but I don't know if I can keep up with them all!
