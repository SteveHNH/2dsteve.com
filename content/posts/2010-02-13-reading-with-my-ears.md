](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/headphones_main_image.gif)I don't know about you guys, but in this culture where we have less and less time to do anything, one of the things I miss the most is having time to sit down and read a book. Between the podcasting, guitar playing, tv series watching, and social networking, I get may be 30 minutes to read before I go to bed at night. This is an awesome time to do it, but I barely have time to dig into a chapter and really zone out with the book. That's where [Audible.com](http://www.audible.com) comes in.

I picked up a subscription with [Audible.com](http://www.audible.com) and it has changed the way that I "read" books. Ash, of [H&H](http://www.horseshoes-handgrenades.com) fame, was giving me crap tonight about listening to books because I've "forgotten how to read." I totally remember how to read, but I've just found a way to enjoy books without having to completely focus. I just don't have time to sit down and read books like Â I used to, so listening to them is a perfect substitute. I'm still imagining everything in the book just like I would if I was reading it. I just get to read in the car...while I'm driving! It's so awesome to actually enjoy a book while doing something would normally not be able to do while reading. Have you ever seen somebody reading while they drive? They are NOT good multi-taskers!

So if you are like me and just don't have time to enjoy books on your couch with your eyes, give your ears a try. It's just as fun, as long as the person reading doesn't sound like [Gilbert Gottfried](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Godfried). That could be a little much.
