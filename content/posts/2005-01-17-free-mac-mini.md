Hey I found this site tonight, www.freeminimacs.com where you can somehow get a free mini mac! This site is by the same people who made freeipods.com and those actually worked! It was verified by the hosts of the screen savers and all kinds of other people who actually got their ipods. It works by you signing up for an account at some place (most of them end up being free) and then you refer 10 friends. They say that the publicity gained from advertising makes up for the price of the mac, thats how they do it.

I signed up for this service tonight and went with the eFax deal because it was thirty day free trail. I'm just gonna cancel it once the website acknowledges that I signed up for it. You guys should try it, help me out by clicking my link for it. It seriously will work! heck yeah!
