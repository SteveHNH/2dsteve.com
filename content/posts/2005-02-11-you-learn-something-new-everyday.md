McGyver's first name is Angus....yeah....Angus like the hamburger. No wonder the guy went by his last name. 

Well, I didn't make it to West Virginia this weekend. My flight was cancelled about 20 minutes before I was set to take off. But thats okay!! Because of all the snow our plans were shot to Hades anyway. So I'm better of going up there next week. I changed my ticket for next Wednesday plus I don't have school Monday so I basically get two extra days! It's awesome, but I still have to wait til Wednesday...ugh. But I'm good!! I'm just gonna do more yard work and stuff to pass the time.

I guess thats all I have to say right now. I'm bored man. Later.
