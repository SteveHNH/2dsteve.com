Man I feel a lot better hearing one of the guys from Blink talking about this whole situation. You can listen to an [audio interview](//kroq.wmod.llnwd.net/a168/o1/kbaudio/TravisBarker.asf) with Travis Barker at [this link](//kroq.wmod.llnwd.net/a168/o1/kbaudio/TravisBarker.asf). He pretty much explains the situation, but its really not more specific than they just want to spend time with families. So[ check it out](//kroq.wmod.llnwd.net/a168/o1/kbaudio/TravisBarker.asf). Its neat.
