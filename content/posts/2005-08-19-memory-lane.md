I picked up a bag of sweet sixteen donuts the other day...now that might not seem like much to YOU but it reminded me of better days!

Me and [Patti](http://pattiwack.blogspot.com) were big fans of this band [Inspection 12](http://www.inspection12.com/) and picking up this bag of donuts totally reminded me how awesome they were! or are! They have a song called Sweet Sixteen and it's awesome, but so is every other song they have. If you haven't listened to this band then I urge you to do so now [by going here! ](http://www.purevolume.com/inspection12)

I want to be in a band again listening to this music..but since that's not giong to happen any time soon, then I'll just sit here, eat donuts, and listen to the music that made me want to play guitar better. Later
