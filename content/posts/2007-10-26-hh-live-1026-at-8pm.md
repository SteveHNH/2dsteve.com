Hey everybody! As most of you know, I do a show with my future sister-in-law Ashley every friday night called Horseshoes & Hand Grenades. We talk about all the stupid news that has occurred in our world over the last week and it ends up being incredibly hilarious and TONS of fun.

Well tomorrow is our live show!! Every 10 episodes we have a live show so our audience can participate and hang out with us for a while. So mozy on over to the [H&H site](http://www.horseshoes-handgrenades.com) so you can get directions on what you need to do to call in to the show! The last time we did this we had a blast and we hope you can join us for another awesome night of laughing at ourselves :)

Hope to hear from you guys!!
