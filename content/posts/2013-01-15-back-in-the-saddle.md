I feel like I may die.

Okay, that was a bit dramatic, but I think it's accurate. I started back on P90X today in order to get myself back in shape. I can't seem to stick to anything, but I'm giving this another go. Way back in 2012 I had actually been fairly consistent with doing exercise. I was really starting to gain some muscle and feel better about myself, but I fell off the wagon hard after about 2 months of doing it. That really bummed me out, and it's always hard to get back at it when that happens. Today was my first day back, and I already wish I had never quit. It's so hard on your body when you first start exercising. I thought I was going to throw up when I finished 0_0.Â <!-- more -->

None of this is all that important though. What IS important is the first issue of "The Superior Spider-Man" launched this week and I got to read it. This is the first issue where we see how the ending of the 700 issue long "The Amazing Spider-Man" pans out for everyone, including Peter Parker. So, Doc Oc has officially taken over Peter Parker's body and is convinced that he is going to be a better hero than Parker ever dreamed of. Only we get to see that Doc Oc is not quite the hero he should be. Needless to say, this post will contain a few spoilers, so watch out below!

](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/?attachment_id=780)I am incredibly upset with this new Spider-Man. That's not to say that I'm entertained by the story, because I think it's a fantastic risk that Dan Slott is taking in changing our favorite wall-crawler's entire personality. There could be a downright lynch mob following this guy around, but he did it anyway. So gone is the wise-cracking Spider-Man that we've loved since the 1960's, and in his place is the logical, calculated, and somewhat angry Spider-Man. Doc Oc's personality bleeds through every bit of Spider-Man and you know good and well that this character can't last in this iteration. You just can't relate to the guy! He's too smart for us and he's too ... evil, I guess. What else do you expect from one of Spidey's greatest villains? Instill all the memories of a good guy that you want, he's still who he is.

The great news is that apparently Peter Parker is still in that brain somewhere, and he's fighting his way back. He stays Oc's hand when he tries to kill one of Spidey's villains! It's kind of weird because you see this ghost Peter, but I don't really think they are going with a ghost type deal. I think Peter Parker is still in that brain, he's just been pushed to the back by all of Doctor Octopus' memories and thoughts. I'm pretty sure the two just got copied to each other brains, but both are still in there somewhere. I'm honestly super excited to see where this goes. I really want Peter back because we've loved him for so long. I think this is a cool opportunity to still change the character a bit though, because once he fights his way out of the mental cage he is in, he'll still have all of Doctor Octopus' skills and memories. That's a pretty big deal. Hopefully he loses the aggression though. But it may make for some really awesome storylines in the future.

All in all, I would say good job on Spidey! Dan Slott has been writing him for a whole crapton of issues and it's been some of the most fun Spider-Man stories I've read. I know he can keep it up, and won't disappoint all the fans :)
