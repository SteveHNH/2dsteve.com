Well, I was officially the first person in Tallahassee to rent Prince of Persia: Warrior Within...and no I'm not exaggerating. They hadn't even put the game out on shelves at blockbuster but the guy gave it to me and said I was the first person to rent the game. I felt all cool.
My first impressions of the game are...well....just wow. Its very different from the first, so different that it almost looks like a totally different game. I was totally offended to find that the prince now has a gritty voice and is incredibly angry. I would be angry too if death had been chasing me for the last few years though. So I don't blame him for that. It's a lot harder this time around too. The enemies are crazy hard to fight and it seems that your health bar virtually disappears in a matter of a few hits. I'm a very hack-and-slash gamer, which means I hate blocking because I feel that it wastes time...the thing is, you have to block or you die in this game. I'm kind of impatient so blocking annoys me, but if I don't block, I die.....Block or Die, thats the game. He does still have all his swinging and jumping moves plus a few more. It's borderline frustrating though because of the great raise in difficulty. I like it though, its just dark and angry and bloody and rated M. Oh well, what game isn't these days.
On another note, I saw [THE FUNNIEST STRONG BAD EMAIL EVER](http://www.homestarrunner.com/) today. Me and Karl watched it in class and died laughing. Its so great, go watch it now. It's called Virus. Its beautiful. Later!
