Wow, I'm thrilled right now to say that my internet is capable of [VoIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP)! I just couldn't get myself to give up on [Skype](http://www.skype.com) because I wanted it to work so bad. I decided to try it again yesterday and I discovered that my upload is much better now and I can clearly communicate with people using this software! I haven't actually been able to try it with somebody yet because nobody has been around *cough* [Lando](http://landoman.blogspot.com) *cough* ;) . So I tried to call the Echo123 robot that you can call and it records your voice and plays it back to you. I was so excited to hear myself really good and pretty clear. So! If you want to talk to me sometime you should download [Skype](http://www.skype.com) and call me, my name is fulltangninja. Surprising isn't it? Anyway, that's it for now! Later!
