I'm not a big fan of new years resolutions. Never have been never will be, but I am a fan of goals and yearly "themes."Having a theme isn't as strict as a resolution and is more of a reminder of how you want the year to go. For me this year's theme is Authenticity. Which for me is not worrying so much about whether someone likes me or not, but just presenting myself as myself the best I can and being able to "take it or leave it" in terms of what people think. This likely won't change much, but should hopefully help me keep in mind that it's not my job to get everyone to like me. It's my job to present myself as authentically as possible so that the people I get to hang out with are there because they want to be.

Outside of that theme, I'm also dead set on staying healthy this year. We're off to a really good start and one of the side effects that I didn't really think about would be that our finances are getting healthier too. We spend a lot of money on eating out, and because we're focused on not doing that, we're saving our waiste line and wallets. I'm definitely feeling good about that. It's making a huge difference aleady and we're just in January. I'm eight pounds down and we don't have a huge credit card bill, which is blowing my mind. Lots of left overs and being mindful of the food we're buying is making a difference.

The world is going insane, but I'm happy to say that at least in this little corner, we're managing the insanity pretty well. I've been largely avoiding news, or at least not digging into it. I'm staying mindful of headlines, but I'm not letting myself go into a dark pit of despair over everything. I can't control so much of what I see or read, and I'll do what I can to help when I see things going south, but I just can't bury myself in it every day and spend all my time worrying and building my anxiety over it.

So far this year is going well. I know we're only in January but it feels good and I'm hoping for the best.
