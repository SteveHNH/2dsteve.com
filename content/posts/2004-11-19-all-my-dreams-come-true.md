Man, It looks like Sam Raimi is resurrecting The Evil Dead one more time. He's unveiled plans to remake the first Evil Dead, this time with a bigger budget! I'm so excited I could wet myself haha. I don't know what is gonna be different about it, but I know that Sam isn't going to direct it because he's busy with Spider-Man 3, but he is overseeing it very closely.
