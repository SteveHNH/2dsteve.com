I think I've finally found a solution to my webspace problem...if you knew I had a webspace problem...I can't remember. Anyway! I found a site today that lets you host your movies, music, pictures, and anything else for FREE. The only catch is that you have to make it accessible to the world, but chances are that if you are doing this then you want people to see it anyway. So I am giving it a try. It's called [OurMedia](http://www.ourmedia.org). It actually looks pretty cool, providing that it works.

I might start uploading video of stuff on here. It'll at least give me a reason to use my video camera, but I have to come up with some content so it's not just me sitting on a couch talking to myself. I think I'll try uploading a video I made a year or two ago about my old band EveningSide. It was kind of a farewell video. I'll probably upload some of the Super Salamander EP for you guys to hear too. It's actually not too bad and there's several people out there that want to hear it but never got a chance. So yeah! Hopefully this stuff will work and I'll let you guys know how it went!
