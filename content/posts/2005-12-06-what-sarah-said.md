I am so hooked on this new Death Cab for Cutie cd. It's one of those cd's that's really so beautiful it makes you want to cry...okay, maybe I'm sappy like that, but hey! I'm also faced with an extremely painful moral dilemma. Okay, maybe it's not a moral dilemma, but it's a dilemma more or less.

I'm getting very bored of playing WoW. I don't know what happened but all the sudden I just don't want to play and I'm getting sick of it. It's the same thing, over and over and over and over. Kill, loot, sell, repeat. That's basically all that's happening. Okay, it might get better when I hit 60 but I don't have any desire to get to 60 and I'm extremely bored. I'm contemplating just canceling my account because it's just not fun anymore. I wish it was, but it's not. I want it to be because how am I going to fit in at work without WoW. I'll probably miss it if I get rid of it, but I just don't care. I might hang on to it just to pass the time, but it's really not fun. I've made like 7 characters in the past few days just trying to find some way to enjoy this game. It's just not happening.

I guess I'm just not a tried and true gamer. I like games, games are fun, but only with other people. Yeah I know, WoW is online and there are tons of other people to play with, but there is nothing like sitting next to somebody rocking out on a game. Baldur's Gate rules because of the social thing. I can smack somebody for doing something stupid because they are right beside me. I have fun with those kinds of games. I'm sick of WoW. It's just boring.
