This is the biggest hog that has ever been found. Some random guy in South Georgia was hunting and then ran across this beast. He claims to have killed it in one shot but a lot of people are skeptical. This is totally true! National Geographic is going to do a show on it I think, or it's at least going to be a segment on a show. The hog was 12 feet long and 1000 lbs!!! They had to use a back-hoe to get the thing off the ground. Ridiculous!!!
