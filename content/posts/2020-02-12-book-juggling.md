I haven't been keeping up with the reading list. I also haven't been keeping up with this blog. Both of these things are **shameful**. I should be doing better, and you, dear reader, deserve better. I'm not going to promise that I'm going to write every day or anything, but I'm going to try to be more active. 







The tough thing about trying to be active in this space is that I need two things: time and energy. I don't typically like to say "I don't have time," because I do. The issue at hand is that I don't have quite as much disposable time (that's a horrible phrase) as I used to. So I have to figure out what to shove in there. To make matters worse, the hours of the day that I can claim as my own, are ones where I kind of just want to switch my brain off after a long day. That's not a good place to be either.







But, I didn't come here to gripe about the number one first world problem of "not having enough time." Because that's silly. We have enough time. We have the same 24 hours in a day that everyone else has. it's how we use it that matters. So, on to the real topic.







I have been reading a TON of books. I usually have one or two going at any given time, but I think I'm up to four at this point. I've increased my time spent reading the Bible because I'm choosing to make that a priority in my life. I was gifted an Audible subscription by the wonderful Jacob and [Ashley](https://www.twitter.com/phatekills). I have a fiction book, a study book, and an non-fiction book. This is all happening at the same time! AH!







I thought it would be hard to manage that much, but I'm finding it pretty easy to keep up with each considering that they are all so far from each other in terms of genre. It's not like having three fantasy novels going at the same time. I'm really enjoying all of these and am digging into them all at different times of the day, which helps to keep them separate in my mind. 







So, I say all that to say, you have a few reading list items to look forward to soon. This is the list I'm working through now:





  * [Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street - Michael Davis](https://amzn.to/2w6yTgl)  
  * [True Grit - Charles Portis](https://amzn.to/2UKlTax)  
  * [Mere Christianity - C.S. Lewis](https://amzn.to/2tRsPaZ)  
  * [Ordering Your Private World - Gordon MacDonald](https://amzn.to/2UKzWwR)





All of these are serving a different facet of my life, and I'm digging them all for different reasons. Reviews coming soon!







Also, I'm looking for a suggestion for my Audible credit for the month. I generally enjoy biographies, autobiographies, and non-fiction stuff via Audible, so let me know if you have anything cool I should check out!
