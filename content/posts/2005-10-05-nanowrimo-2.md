It's that time of year again! Pick up your pencils...or keyboards for you modern writers..and start writing random stuff!

You can sign up at [NaNoWriMo.org](http://www.nanowrimo.org) and then use a blog or live journal or whatever to start writing the novel you've always wanted to write! The only catch is that you only have 30 days. 30 days to write a 50,000+ word novel. Yeah, it's a TON of writing. I tried last year...well I guess if setting up a blog for it is trying, then yeah, I tried. I didn't get started though. I might try it again this year and actually give writing a shot but I don't know. I like writing, I just don't know if I'm creative enough for it all.

Anyway, just wanted to let you all know that it's time to sign up again if you wish to participate in this insanely populer month of spastic, pedal to the metal writing. Have fun!
