](http://www.bitsandbinary.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/fireworks.jpg)This is my four hundredth post since starting this blog in September of 2004. I can't believe I've actually had it running that long and haven't completely abandoned it. I know that I've let it go for a month or two at a time, but I'm still keeping it up and that, to me, is an accomplishment. When I started this thing I really just wanted a place to put down thoughts and ideas and to keep me busy while I was stuck out in the middle of nowhere in Florida. Now I look back and read some old posts and it's really awesome to see what I thought about way back then and what I was doing. Crazy how things change over the course of just a few years.

Speaking of changes, I have since moved to Morgantown, WV to be with my fiance. That's a big one. I'm up here right now after a good trip to Charlotte, NC to drop my buddy [Lando](http://www.landoman.com) off at the airport for a three month stint in Thailand. While we were down there I bought those camera accessories that I talked about in the last post, and I am now rid of them. [Lando](http://www.landoman.com) was right when he told me they were both pieces of crap. They were most DEFINATELY pieces of crap. I took them back to [Circuit City](http://www.circuitcity.com) on my way up to Motown so that's thirty bucks I have back in my pocket. The pouch for my camera sucked because it was too tight and kept getting glue on my camera, and the tripod was just non-functional.

Well, now that I'm back up home and have stolen the Xbox 360 from Steph, I can get started on playing Prince of Persia. Steph beat it so I now have the opportunity to play through and see what all the fuss is about. Then I guess I can start tearing through all the games that [Landon](http://www.landoman.com) let me borrow while he's gone. Looks like I have a lot to do.

That's 400 posts down. A whole crapload more to go! Thanks for reading!
