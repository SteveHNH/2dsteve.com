Man, I just had so much fun listening to the old Screen Savers crew on [this podcast](http://leoville.com/blog/index.php/TLR/comments/new-tlr-podcast/) from [Leoville.com](http://www.leoville.com/), Leo Laporte's site. They were talking about MacWorld but there was plenty of shots at G4 haha. [Kevin Rose](http://www.kevinrose.com/), Patrick Norton, his wife, Leo Laporte, Roger Chang, and David Prager were all there just talking about stuff. It's so much fun to listen to. If you've ever watched the old screen savers you guys should check it out. [Kevin Rose](http://www.thebroken.org/) has plans to start a web-based show that is basically the old screen savers. He's even gonna have the old cast on there from time to time. I'm too excited. So go [check it out HERE!

This is why I need to do The Screen Savers because I don't know how to do this stuff. - Leo Laporte
