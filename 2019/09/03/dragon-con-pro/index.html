<span class=reading-time>3-minute read</span></div></div><p>I&rsquo;m currently in an overwhelming state of gratefulness. Ash and I were able to accomplish something we were unsure would ever happen. We played a show at Dragon Con. Not only that, but it went incredibly well. I have no idea why people decided to line up, but I&rsquo;m forever grateful to those people for the gift they gave us. We walked out of that show feeling like we belonged there.</p><p>The entire weekend was magical for me. I&rsquo;ve been to Dragon Con now four times, and I&rsquo;ve never had an experience like this one. We usually went to see some podcasts live, line up for celebrity panels, and go see some cosplay. I went this time with the sole desire to see my friends and meet some new ones on the digital media track. That truly made it worth doing. I feel like a part of something, and a peer with the folks I respect so much.</p><p>I think it was just being part of something authentic that made it so much better. It&rsquo;s nice to go see celebrities smile and do their thing, but I found a group of folks in the basement of the Hilton that get to do their thing, but they also get to just be themselves when the lights go down. I got to be a part of that. To stand around and ask each other about what we do, or hear them talk so passionately about the reason they want to talk about stuff on the internet.</p><p>I sat at a table with people I respect and talked about stuff other than podcasting, just to get an idea of what they like to do and find out more about who they are.</p><p>What I walked away with is the most important thing. Ashley and I belong there. We got a place at the table, and we discovered that it was because we had something to contribute. We sat there as peers. Having just been audience members for years, we&rsquo;re now part of the team. I want to definitely continue and I want to expand what I was able to do this year and help more. Now I&rsquo;m itching to moderate a panel, to join in the conversation, and to keep these relationships going.</p><p>Our show was recorded and we&rsquo;ll get the master audio and video soon so other folks can hear what went on. I have so many people I need to thank for this opportunity, but I know I&rsquo;ll miss someone. So mainly I just want to say thanks to everyone who has supported us as we&rsquo;ve done this show. Now all I can think about is how much it all means to me. Everyone who has ever downloaded the show has contributed some small piece of joy to me. That makes it all worth it.</p><p>Dragon Con was unbelievable. I cannot wait to do it all over again next year.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a><a class=category href=/categories/podcasting/>podcasting</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.2dsteve.com/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
