<span class=reading-time>2-minute read</span></div></div><p>I&rsquo;m very upset that I haven&rsquo;t had a whole lot of time to write this week, but my flight was all jacked up on Sunday night. I was all set to come back home on the plane from Tallahassee, but the great air traffic controller somewhere out there decided that Atlanta was too busy and my plane needed to wait at least 30 minutes before we took off. I was devastated! I only had a 30 minute layover in Atlanta to catch my plane to Pittsburgh&mldr;yeah, I missed it. It really wasn&rsquo;t all that bad though! I got to hang out with some super cool people and one flaming gay dude while we were trying to get on the next plane. He was kind of irate over missing his plane, but was nice enough to keep his place in line when the gate moved.</p><p>Needless to say, I made the second plane out of Pittsburgh which happened to also be the last plane IN to Pittsburgh. I ended up making it home at 2am and falling asleep. I still haven&rsquo;t unpacked half of my crap, but that&rsquo;s because I came home and got som actual sleep yesterday. I was falling apart!</p><p>I had a blast while I was in Florida though and I wanted to go back immediately. Coming back to an empty apartment sucks. If Steph was up in Morgantown with me it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad, but with her in Beckley this place is just crappy. It&rsquo;s been sunny the past few days though so that makes a difference. At least it&rsquo;s not overcast and snowing like it has been for the last MONTH! I get to go home on Thursday and see Steph for new year&rsquo;s day also so that makes me feel pretty good. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind another trip to Florida pretty soon. I miss my family too much :)</p><p>By the way, I just got finished watching Leatherheads on blu-ray and it was very good. I think you guys should go pick it up. It wasn&rsquo;t the best movie I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but it was definitely an enjoyable afternoon flick.</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a></span></div></div></div></div></div></div><script type=text/javascript src=https://www.2dsteve.com/js/jquery.min.decb4e8fdab5cb7b76ec6470b6fb73d30c7ee8e248d7486f49007f3c525b7acb.js integrity="sha256-3stOj9q1y3t27GRwtvtz0wx+6OJI10hvSQB/PFJbess=" crossorigin=anonymous></script>
