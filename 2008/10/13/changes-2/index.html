I can&rsquo;t even begin to tell you guys how awesome it is to have a normal relationship with my fiance, instead of the long distance, never see each other crap that we have dealth with for the past 5 years. I have learned more about her and appreciated her more than I ever have because right now she is all I have close to rely on. When I was in Florida I had my family and friends to run to if I had to, but here it&rsquo;s just me and her. It has definitely made me want to get married sooner because we&rsquo;re so close and since I&rsquo;m staying with her right now it almost feels like we are anyway.</p><p>One of the big things I&rsquo;ve been dealing with over the last couple months is not having a job. I got accepted for a position after only about two weeks, but they&rsquo;ve had to finalize stuff and get me a start date which is taking longer that I would have wanted. It&rsquo;s a contract position kind of like my position with ASD a few years ago, but that&rsquo;s okay. I figure that as long as I have a paycheck coming in I should be happy. I&rsquo;m a little nervous about the drive and where I&rsquo;m actually working, but hopefully all that will fade as I get used to the commute and environment. It&rsquo;s only about 40 minutes away, but after living 5 minutes from work for 2 years, this is quite a difference.</p><p>I want to get an apartment soon but I&rsquo;m waiting on my start date from this new job and to find out how much I&rsquo;m going to be bringing home each pay period. Now I have to factor in gas and a bigger bill for rent. I think I&rsquo;ll be fine though since I usually had a ton left over when I had a roommate and never needed gas. I&rsquo;ll just have to adjust some of my spending habits. If I could just quit eating out so much I would be a lot better off. But, man, those calzones are so good!</p><p>I&rsquo;ve really got to start motivating myself better. I have been pretty much lounging around and playing WoW a ton since I haven&rsquo;t had a job. I came up here with all these intentions for doing things with Horseshoes & Hand Grenades and making myself do stuff so I don&rsquo;t get used to the leisure lifestyle. Needless to say, the week I wanted to relax turned into a few weeks that I just wanted to relax. I&rsquo;m going to have a hard time pulling myself out of bed when everything gets started I think . I&rsquo;ll be fine I know, and I think it&rsquo;s just the nerves talking. I need a schedule!</p><p>Things are good though and I thought I would just update the blog to let everybody who reads it know how I&rsquo;m doing. I have way too many thoughts in my head right now so I better stop before I ramble way too much. Talk to you guys later!</p></div><div class=post-footer><div class=info><span class=separator><a class=category href=/categories/life/>Life</a></span>
